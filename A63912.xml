            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT may ſeem, for ought I know, prepoſterous to ſome, to call that which I now publiſh an <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical Vindication,</hi> for why ſhould I vindicate that which is not accuſed? or make an Apology for that which no man cenſures? But when I conſider how ſtrong the current of the beſt Writers upon the ſubject I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, hath run againſt that notion which I have endeavoured to eſtabliſh, I could not think it modeſt to diſſent from ſo many and ſo Learned men, without giving a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my ſelf, and without endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to explain, illuſtrate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:93763:4"/> what I had written by a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct review of the whole matter, and by an addition of new Arguments and Circumſtances to ſtrengthen mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which I hope I have done with that clearneſs of expreſſion and that force of reaſon, that will convince the moſt obſtinate, and abundantly ſatisfy the moſt doubting mind.</p>
            <p>For my part, I declare I have no other concern in it, then that I would have the truth to appear, the truth, which I have always, and which I ſhall always prefer before any private intereſt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whatſoever, as I am indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably obliged to do by my duty as a man, and as a Chriſtian, and by my profeſſion as a Divine, by which I am under a ſtill more particular and preſſing obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, to promote, encourage, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate all thoſe notions, whoſe belief hath a tendency to the happineſs of the world, and to diſcountenance and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:93763:4"/> as much as in me lies all that have a tendency to deſtroy its peace and welfare; for I am either very much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in my ſentiments of things, or there is nothing practically or politically true, which it is not very much for the intereſt of the world that it ſhould be known. Indeed if Divinity were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an Art, a meer Trick and a Juggle to impoſe upon the People, and to enrich its Profeſſors, then it would be true in another ſence, than that in which it is uſually taken, <hi>artis eſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare artem,</hi> and an oath of ſecrecy ought to be taken of every man that enters into Orders, that he ſhould not betray the <hi>Arcana</hi> of his Function, which it would be impoſſible for any man to do, without bringing ruin and diſgrace upon it: but ſince we intend nothing but the good of the world in the firſt place, and do not aim at any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate advantage any further then is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:93763:5"/> with that, why ſhould we not be frank and open in what we do? It is for them to cant and talk myſteries, that cannot preach uſeful ſenſe, or ſpeak intelligible <hi>Engliſh,</hi> them that uphold a Party by flights of Enthuſiaſme, and certain uncouth abſurdities of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and decry carnal reaſon for no other cauſe, but only that either they do not underſtand it, or elſe that they are ſenſible it is no friend of theirs: but Nature and true Religion are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of a mind, and this is the great fault of the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> doctrines, that they contradict experience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bid a perpetual defiance to humane fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and to common ſenſe, which if the Scripture it ſelf ſhould always do, it would be no Argument that <hi>Calvin</hi> was in the right, but only that they themſelves were very much out of the ſtory, and were not really the word of God, as they pretend to be.</p>
            <pb n="v" facs="tcp:93763:5"/>
            <p>I mention the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, becauſe there is a connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the divine obduration and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; and I call it the humane, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> neceſſity is a neceſſity of mans making, and they have both of them the ſame effect; that is, they do things they know not why, and they act after ſuch or ſuch a manner, becauſe they cannot help it; only they differ in the cauſe, that is to ſay, one of theſe neceſſities is acted from without, and the other from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, one is a real neceſſity of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the other pretends to be a neceſſity of nature.</p>
            <p>It was therefore very ſuitable and congruous in a diſcourſe of the former, to take ſo fair an occaſion to conſider the latter likewiſe; and the rather becauſe thoſe very Texts of Scripture which do ſo plainly evidence and demonſtrate the one, are produced by thoſe that aſſert
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:93763:6"/> 
               <hi>the reprobation</hi> for the defence and maintenance of the other, with how much diſingenuity, and how little skill I think I have ſufficiently manifeſted to the world, and have ſo fairly explained the beloved ninth of the <hi>Romans</hi> about which ſo much noiſe hath been made, and ſo much hath been written to ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe by the contending Parties.</p>
            <p>Nay, I have turned their own Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non upon themſelves, I have engaged this very Chapter in the quarrel againſt them; and <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> the younger and the Elder, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> the ſeed of the Bondwoman and the promiſed ſeed, however diſagreeing and angry with each other, have upon this occaſion joyned all their Forces, and laid a formal Siege to <hi>Geneva,</hi> neither is it at all to be doubted, but they will carry the place, whether you conſider the ſtrength and courage of the Aſſailants o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he one ſide, or on
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:93763:6"/> the other the weak and defenceleſs condition of the Town, its want of Proviſion to hold out, or Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to defend it ſelf, and annoy the confederated leaguer of nature and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation by which it is ſo cloſely begrit.</p>
            <p>That which I now publiſh was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as you will ſee by the beginning, and by ſeveral paſſages up and down in it, only by way of preface to that other diſcourſe which is already abroad, but it grew ſo long before I was well aware, that it was much bigger than the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe it ſelf, to which it was intended to be prefixt; it was therefore beter that it ſhould be publiſhed by it ſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently after the other; for it would have been abſurd to refer to a Diſcourſe which was not yet in being; beſides that it will be much better it ſhould come out as it does, for this reaſon, that the other having been already perus'd and digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you will be the better able as you read
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:93763:7"/> along to underſtand this, and to make a judgment of both: and therefore that you may the better compare both of them together, I have added a common <hi>Index</hi> of the chief Heads of both at the latter end. So that all you have to do, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Preface,</hi> in the beginning to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> and by the word <hi>following</hi> in ſeveral places, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand as much as if I had ſaid <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going,</hi> which it is no great matter for one friend to do for another, and then all is well and as it ſhould be: or if you do not like this way of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though it be as good as many that come from very able Expoſitors and profound Divines, then take your own way. And though you laugh at the Title, which you may do and welcome, if you pleaſe, yet be ſo juſt to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument notwithſtanding, as to give it that reſpect which it deſerves.</p>
            <p>I cannot pretend to add much in this
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:93763:7"/> place, to what I have already written, but becauſe being lately injured by the malice of an ill man, whom I know not, and therefore forgive him unſight and unſeen, I did in the heat of my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, draw up a juſt and true Character and repreſentation of my ſelf, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſecond thoughts, I have ſuppreſt, as I have many other things, to the great detriment and deſtruction of Pen, Ink, and Paper, which might be imployed for better uſes; in which tumultuary ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I did among other things, declare my opinion as to the points in difference betwixt thoſe whom they call in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the <hi>Remonſtrants and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonſtrants,</hi> ſo far as thoſe points are determinable upon the Principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the inſerting of which in this place may do ſome ſervice to the cauſe I have undertaken; therefore I have thought fit to inſert it in the words that follow, and to beg of you no greater favour than
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:93763:8"/> what in juſtice I may challenge at your hands, that you would read it with the ſame ingenuity, candor and good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with which it was written by me.</p>
            <p>[For the points in Diſpute betwixt the <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, I make no manner of ſcruple to affirm, that the former of theſe are certainly in the right, and that the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them by turning men into Beaſts, and by making it impoſſible for a man by his natural ſtrength to make the leaſt attempt at any thing that is good, or to harbour the leaſt degree of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous inclination, but on the contrary, to be carried forth by an irreſiſtible propenſity of will to all manner of wickedneſs, and to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſin, as well as to the moſt deteſtable inſtances of it; (as Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> and his Followers in ſo many words are pleaſed to do) have done a very great and a very unpardonable affront
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:93763:8"/> to humane nature, and that it would never be endured, if any one man ſhould beſpatter his Neighbour at that rate, at which they have taken the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence upon them to reproach and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the whole race of Mankind. I reckon that they are every whit as bad Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers as they are Divines, and that ſince men do naturally carry different conſtitutions and temperaments about them; by which it appears plainly that ſome men are by nature and by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular happineſs of their conſtitution, more vertuouſly diſpoſed than others: which diſpoſitions may either be height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or corrupted, or perfectly deſtroyed by difference of Company, different ways of Study, different courſes of Life, and different methods of Education.</p>
            <p>Again, ſince as ſome conſtitutions are in the general more virtuouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpos'd than others, ſo there is none ſo good as not to be carried forth with a
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:93763:9"/> greater or leſſer inclination to ſin; and ſince it appears in every man's obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that one temperament is naturally inclined to one ſort or ſpecies of evil, and another to another, which inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may likewiſe be heightened, or in a great meaſure conquered and ſubdued, by the ſame means by which the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to vertue and good manners are either cultivated, or leſſened or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I ſay, ſince theſe things are ſo in the open view and appearance of all mankind, ſince they are ſo plain, ſo manifeſt, ſo undenyably certain from the daily experience both of our ſelves and others, what can be more fooliſh then to ſay that all men are irreſiſtibly, that is, equally inclined by nature to all manner of vice? or to affirm that nothing but an irreſiſtible Grace can hinder the beſt of men from being worſe than the moſt fierce, untameable and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Beaſts themſelves, as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:93763:9"/> expreſly does, and it is no more then what does unavoidably follow from his doctrine of irreſiſtible pravity and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. But yet I am very far from bidding defyance to the ſpirit of Grace, very far from ſinking into the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> or ſo much, as into the <hi>Maſſilian</hi> or <hi>Semi-pelagian</hi> error; I do believe and am taught by the word of God, and by my own experience of my ſelf and others, that without the <hi>Grace of God</hi> it is impoſsible to do that which is truly pleaſing and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in his ſight: I believe there will always be, through the confeſſed pravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the beſt natures, ſuch a mixture of corruption, by the interpoſition or intervention of carnal or prohibited deſires, by which our zeal for Goodneſs will be always either cool'd, diverted or deſtroyed, that even our beſt Actions will not be accepted of God, without the aſſiſtance of his Grace to give them
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:93763:10"/> a beauty, conſummation and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which they could not have received from our ſelves: I believe that as vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions or diſpoſitions cannot be perfect, ſo much leſs can virtuous ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits be attained without the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and perpetual, though not irreſiſtible aſſiſtance of the ſame ſpirit, which is as neceſſary to create in us ſometimes good diſpoſitions and much more good habits, but always to aſſure and perfect them; as the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to attone for our bad ones, or his interceſſion to apply the merits of that death and paſſion to the ſeveral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect degrees of our repentance or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life.</p>
            <p>I do believe, and am verily in my conſcience perſwaded, that God who in the Creation of the world, and in the admirable contrivance of it, for its own preſervation, and for the well-being and happineſs of its inhabitants, hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:93763:10"/> ſo much goodneſs; he that in the ſtructure of the bodies of all <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> and in the proviſion which he hath made for the reſpective ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of them all, according to their ſeveral natures and conſtitutions, hath plainly ſhewed himſelf to be a very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and Gracious Being; he that hath ordered and created all things in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, weight and meaſure, he that out of nothing hath rear'd this comely Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the World, ſo full of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs as well as beauty, both of which do almoſt equally declare him to be not an angry, mercileſs, and revengeful, but a ſerene, compoſed, benevolent and Gracious mind: I ſay, I do believe and am verily perſwaded, that ſuch a Being as this, would not, or rather could not with conſiſtence to himſelf, condemn almoſt all mankind, all the ſucceſſions, ages, and generations of Men, Women and Children, (as Conquerours do when
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:93763:11"/> they put Towns to the Sword) to infinite inſufferable and eternal Torments, with out any fault of their own, but only for one ſingle diſobedience and tranſgreſsion of their firſt Parents, which it was not poſsible for them, being yet unborn, to prevent: and yet this is no more than what Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> and his adherents do expreſly aſſert.</p>
            <p>I believe that the <hi>Supralapſarian</hi> and <hi>Sublapſarian</hi> Doctrine, one of which makes God to have decreed the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him the fall of all Mankind; the other only to have foreknown it, and to have condemned the infinitely greateſt number of men upon that ſuppoſition, to be equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and deteſtable, becauſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine foreknowledge cannot be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and therefore to condemn men upon a condition that will certainly take effect, is the ſame thing as to condemn them without any condition at all.</p>
            <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:93763:11"/>
            <p>I believe that that Doctrine which makes all humane actions and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be abſolutely neceſſary, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable and fatal, by aſcribing them all either to an irreſiſtible corruption or an irreſiſtible Grace, does manifeſtly deſtroy the nature of morality and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of religion too; for every man muſt be denominated either good or bad, not from the action of another but his own, not from that action to which he is irreſiſtibly determined, but from that which he may either do or omit, which he may promote or ſlacken, or perfectly deſtroy by a certain Principle of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from within. I believe that this Doctrine is every whit as great, nay, a much greater excuſe and diſpenſation for ſin, then any <hi>Papal</hi> Indulgence or diſpenſation can be; I believe it is not only deſtructive of virtue and good manners in ſingle men conſidered by themſelves, but that conſidering them
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:93763:12"/> as members of a ſociety it deſtroys all mutual faith and confidence in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it pulls up all manner of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the roots, and by an unreſiſtible force and power it diſſolves or rather tears in ſunder, breaks into ſhivers and crumbles into duſt the firmeſt and moſt aſſured Religion of an oath; and therefore I cannot wonder that any man ſhall take an Oath to qualify him for an Office or Employment, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he pretends, but he is very much deceived, he would by no means have taken, nor to ſee him break it when he hath done, for no man can keep his Oath any longer than he can, and according to this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help the taking of this Oath, nor the giving of this reaſon why he took it, nor the being deceived in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which he gives, nor the breaking it after he had given ſuch a reaſon.</p>
            <pb n="xix" facs="tcp:93763:12"/>
            <p>I believe that the turning all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into Puppets &amp; <hi>Machines</hi> as this Doctrine manifeſtly does, is the vileſt reproach and ignominy that can be caſt upon it, and then to ſay we promiſe, and threaten, and entreat, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, that we puniſh and reward one another, that we are firſt made to commit ſins, and then to bewail or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs them, to ſay that we do what we could not avoid, and are ſorry for what we cannot help, or that we cannot help that very ſorrow it ſelf, no more then we could the actions that occaſion it, nor the reformation which is conſequent upon it, nor the repeated enormities which frequently enſue when that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is forgotten, as by degrees it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually is, is to turn mankind into things very deſpicable and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to themſelves, and to convert all humane actions into ridicule, where we our ſelves being Parties all the
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:93763:13"/> way, have nothing to do but to pity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man his own abuſed ſelf, and yet cannot forbear laughing at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>For what more comical or pleaſant can poſſibly be conceived, then for this man to look as if he were in a brown ſtudy, laying of cauſes and effects toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and being as free as the air, or as freedome it ſelf can make him; as the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> themſelves do naturally think when they are contemplating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any deſign, to ſee another look an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and meditating revenge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving a thouſand cruel ſtratagems within himſelf to bring the deſperate intrigue to paſs; and to behold a third ſmiling at ſome inward conceit, and following, as he believes, a pleaſant imagination, with a voluntary purſuit, as it is natural for every man in this caſe to do, and yet all this while they are all three mightily deceived, for all this
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:93763:13"/> is but one and the ſame numerical individual fate, putting on new ſhapes and appearances in ſeveral Perſons, and diſplaying it ſelf only for this reaſon, becauſe it cannot help it, like the ſpaſmes and diſtortions of one in a Convulſive or Epileptical Fit, with a ſtrange variety of Poſtures and Grimaces.</p>
            <p>But yet as pleaſant as it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſo diverting a ſpectacle in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yet when we behold it in our ſelves, the mirth will be quite daſht, and the Comedy ended with an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Epilogue, reflecting upon us, and ſpoken either by us, looking inwardly upon our ſelves, or one of thoſe who was the object of our mirth before, and who looks upon us with every whit as much contempt &amp; laughter as we do upon him.</p>
            <p>I believe that this Doctrine is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as well as for other reaſons that have been already ſuggeſted, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:93763:14"/> prejudicial to the publick good, becauſe the reflecting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute fatality of all humane actions and events, and that things will be as they muſt be, let us will and endeavour what we pleaſe, whoſe very wills and endeavours are acted and influenced by a neceſſity not to be reſiſted, is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally productive of a melancholly liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs, careleſſneſs and ſloth, and gives a perpetual damp and cheque to all great deſigns or uſeful underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings; and if men do endeavour not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, to do things worthy of praiſe or of reward, it is only then when either they do not believe this Doctrine, which is the caſe of all men in the common actions of life, in which till they come to diſpute about the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they generally ſuppoſe themſelves and one another to be free, and do by themſelves and by one another, as if they were really of this opinion; or
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:93763:14"/> elſe it is then, when although they do believe, and are perhaps very zealous to maintain it, yet they do not attend to the conſequences of it.</p>
            <p>Neither is it ſufficient in this caſe to ſay, what I know very well is uſually pleaded, that all the conſequences of opinions, or all the poſſible corollaries reſulting from the acknowledgment of ſuch or ſuch a propoſition, are not to be charged upon all that aſſert that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or look upon ſuch a propoſition, as a matter of undoubted truth; for though it be true indeed that in an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which I have newly taken up, and have not ſufficiently enquired into, all the abſurd conſequences that follow from it are not preſently to be charged upon me, as if I maintained the one as well as the other; yet when thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences have been manifeſtly ſhewn to be the inſeparable companions of ſuch or ſuch an opinion, this is a <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratio
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:93763:15"/> per abſurdum,</hi> that the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it ſelf is eroneous and falſer; and if theſe conſequences have been charged upon me a thouſand times over, which is the caſe in the preſent debate, without my ever ſo much as pretending to ſhow that there is no ſuch real conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as is pretended; then it is too late for me to plead ignorance any longer, but I muſt of neceſſity either own the conſequences, or diſcard my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion together with them.</p>
            <p>But though the abſolute neceſſity of all humane actions be an opinion ſo abſurd and ridiculous in it ſelf, and drawing ſuch horrid conſequences after it, yet I do not ſay that in all our actions tendencies or inclinations, we enjoy a perfect and entire freedom neither; for the contrary of this is manifeſt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, for we are more free to ſome inſtances of virtue then we are to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the ſeveral inclinations toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:93763:15"/> with the ſeveral degrees and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of them, that are to be met with in ſeveral conſtitutions to this or that unreaſonable action or enjoyment, in one conſtitution to one ſort of inſtances, and in another to another, are to be looked upon by their perpetual ſollicitation of our better part, and hindering it from the true and undiſturbed exerciſe of it ſelf, to be a degree of neceſſity ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced upon it.</p>
            <p>For we are to be conſidered as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a Compound or <hi>Heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> nature, we conſiſt of a ſoul and body, that is, of an active, ſelf-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or free, and of a paſſive or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Principle, the latter of which is a perpetual clogg and hindrance to the former.</p>
            <p>By being united in a very cloſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and intimate manner with it, it is the ſeed of all concupiſcence, all-preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, inadvertency, ignorance, precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy,
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:93763:16"/> paſſion and folly, and according to the ſeveral conſtitutions of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Principle, that is, according to the ſeveral modifications, configurations, motions, conſiſtencies and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the material part, united to the immaterial and immortal nature; ſo there ariſe different tendencies and various diſpoſitions in the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality or <hi>Compoſitum</hi> taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to this or that vice, infirmity, or frailty, this or that evil habit or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowable practice; in one man to Luſt, in another to Pride or Ambition, in another to Diſſimulation or Falſhood, in another to Covetouſneſs or ſordid and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious living, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And that theſe things are owing to the material nature, appears from this, that theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:93763:16"/> to ſpeak, that is, they deſcend by way of Generation from Father to Son, and that a proud man, that is one that in his conſtitution is exceſſively ſo, cannot appear humble or affable though he would never ſo fain, and when he endeavours it, it does ſo ill become him, that in his pretences to humility, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his Pride. A man that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to craft and over-reaching, though he do ſo far ſubdue the malignity of his nature, as to hinder himſelf from doing any actual wrong, yet he manages e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven juſt things and honeſt deſigns with a ſort of intrigue peculiar to his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and does his beſt actions with ſo much artifice and ſlight of hand, as if he were about to couzen or deceive. An angry man though by reaſon and Philoſophy, by long exerciſe and practice upon himſelf, he may in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure tame and mollify his temper, yet upon any ſudden motion the beaſt will
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:93763:17"/> return again, and he is not able to withſtand a ſurpriſe, though he be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive an expected provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and on the contrary, a man of a more cool and temperate diſpoſition, though ſuch be uſually the beſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and the moſt uſeful men, and though he may have computed the true value of things, how little deſirable it is to live, and how little to be fear'd for a Good man to dye, though he be prepared and armed in his mind againſt foreſeen dangers, and probably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending evils, when they appear at a diſtance from him, yet a ſudden and unexpected aſſault, which would rouſe up courage and anger in another, creates nothing but paleneſs and a damp terrour in him, againſt which it is as naturally impoſsible for him to make any reſiſtance, as it is to ſtand under the preſſures of ſome mighty weight, which is exceedingly too heavy for his
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:93763:17"/> ſtrength to bear; and ſo it is with one that is naturally addicted to a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, paraſitical and inſinuating way of ſpeech, or to an obſequious complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance and flattery in his <hi>Mine;</hi> this man though he have the virtue not to make that uſe of theſe qualities for which they are fitted and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by nature, yet he can no more tell how to ſpeak or act after the ſame plain and unaffected manner that other men do, then a Fiſh can live out of Water, or a Diver live perpetually in it, but his very kindneſſes look as if he had a deſign upon you, and with his ſmiles he gives you warning to have a care of your Pockets.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſhall have ſome of Grave and comely aſpect, whoſe Poſtures are full of gravity, and their <hi>Mine</hi> of wiſdom, and yet if you view their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, though but with a careleſs and a tranſient eye, you ſhall find them as
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:93763:18"/> empty as an old Pollard, which time hath rendered hollow, ſo that it hath nothing within notwithſtanding that by reaſon of its age and thickneſs, the tallneſs of it's Trunk, and the ſpreading of its Root, by reaſon of its outward majeſty and venerable appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it command a reſpect from the younger Trees of the Forreſt: And yet this man, though he be not void of ſo much ordinary diſcretion as to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage himſelf tolerably well, that is, without any great inconvenience to himſelf, or to the publick, whether you conſider him as a private and ſingle man, or as a member of the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, though he can be temperate and friendly, and juſt, yet all the Study, and all the Education in the world, will never make him really wiſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it poſſible for him though he would never ſo fain not to appear as if he were ſo.</p>
            <pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:93763:18"/>
            <p>There are others that are naturally enclined to be full of apiſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky tricks, that affect little featreſſes and humours in their converſation, and with this affectation of littleneſs, and ſeeming folly, there are ſome that have real wit and wiſdom, and others no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Mummery and Grimace. There are ſome whoſe temper inclines them to believe they underſtand Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to cenſure matters of State; and others that out of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affectation of appearing wiſe, will ſet up, as it happens, either for great <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> or down-right <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts:</hi> ſome are for peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon any terms, and others can endure nothing but to live in a flame: there are ſome that affect to ſhrugg un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of Kingdoms, with which they have nothing to do; and ſome that by nature are diſpoſed to mind their own buſineſs, and leave the

            <p>And as the imperfections of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature are all of them conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and owing to the union of the Soul with Matter, and to the different modification of that Matter to which it is ſo cloſely and intimately united, ſo alſo thoſe things which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted perfections are in a great meaſure owing to the ſame cauſe; for as there are ſome that are by nature ſordid and parſimonious, ſo it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plain and evident by experience, that there are others whoſe temper does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:93763:19"/> very ſtrongly encline them to be generous and obliging, who are very ready to lay hold of all the occaſions and opportunities of doing good, and take a particular pleaſure in the ſenſe of having done it; as there are ſome that are by conſtitution ſubject to be fierce, unmerciful and cruel; ſo there are others that are as exceſſive, and perhaps, in ſome inſtances, as much to blame, in an immoderate pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; and there are others whoſe <hi>Genius</hi> is Philoſophical, and ſtrictly juſt without either pity on the one hand or cruelty on the other.</p>
            <p>Innocent mirth, eaſineſs of acceſs, affability in converſation, an unaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſoftneſs and ſweetneſs of behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, are things that are deſervedly accounted felicities and perfections, becauſe they tend to the ſtrengthening the Band and Cement of Friendſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, and they do unavoidably
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:93763:20"/> force a warm affection and eſteem from us wherever they are found; as on the contrary, auſterity joyned with juſtice and with wiſdom does always procure authority and veneration, and will as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably extort reſpect, though mingled at the ſame time with ſome kind of fear and apprehenſion of the Perſons to whom that reverence and reſpect is pay'd, and both of theſe where they are not rooted and riveted in nature, they cannot be counterfeited or diſſembled by art, though they may be improved by it, and all that we do or can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the Soul, being only this, that it is a cogitant, ſelf-active, immaterial Being, all that we underſtand by Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Body, being that it is a thing or nature, impenetrable, extended, and paſſive; it follows plainly from theſe two notions compared together, that the latter can have no ſenſe or feeling of any thing, but what is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:93763:20"/> to it by the former, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being an uniform or ſimilar thing, and having exactly the ſame nature and notion in all the ſeveral perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities wherein it is found, it is plain that this natural difference or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement or diſproportion that is found in the wiſdom, the wit, the humour, or inclination of one man from another, is neither wholly owing to the matter, nor to the cogitant or immaterial part, but it reſults from the union of them both together, and from the different modes of that myſterious union in one perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality and another. Which things are ſo true, that the great attainments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which men are uſed to value and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem themſelves, and upon the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to deſpiſe or contemn any other: the great perfections and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that make ſuch a noiſe in the world, which fill the Standers by with admiration, and the Poſſeſſours with

<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:93763:22"/> why in Poetry all men that underſtand what good Poetry is, or have read all that have written both ancient and modern, yet cannot be good Poets themſelves; why he that is excellent at <hi>Satyr,</hi> yet perhaps ſhall be able to do little or nothing in the <hi>Heroique</hi> way; or he that ſhall write an excellent <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darique,</hi> would do but very lamely at an <hi>Epick</hi> Poem; or why there are others who are ſick of <hi>Moſchus</hi> his diſeaſe, and cannot write well of any thing but Love; why in Painting one ſhall be excellent at Landſcape, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Story, another at the Life; why one ſhall deſign very well, and do great things of his own, but cannot endure the tediouſneſs of Copying, or the pains of Imitation; another ſhall imitate or copy to admiration, but can do very little out of his own fancy or deſign; why he that is Mathematically given, can take no Pleaſure, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:93763:22"/> looks upon them as a ſort of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious trifles, in the flights or ſoftneſſes of a lofty Poem, or an excellent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and why on the contrary a Poet or an Orator ſhall look upon the Mathematicks or the crabbed niceties of Scholaſtick Learning, as things that are dry and unpleaſant, things that do by no means deſerve his pains, and ſuch as it is impoſſible for him ever to lend his patience, or beſtow his attendance upon them; why he that is wholly given to the Study of Languages, as ſome ſuch there are, and are good for nothing elſe, thinks him only fit to be called or thought a great Schollar, who upon occaſion could have been Interpreter to all the Builders at <hi>Babel,</hi> while another is ſo wholly of another mind, that he thinks of this man with nothing but contempt, and hath no reliſh of any thing but real and uſeful knowledge;
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:93763:23"/> and a thouſand more ſuch differences might be produced, the reaſons of which are placed in the particular <hi>Genius</hi> of the perſons to whom they belong, that is, in their particular conſtitutions, in which the ſeeds or cauſes of all theſe either excellencies or defects are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>And according to the different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of care, induſtry and ſtudy, the different happineſſes or infelicities of Fortune or Education, ſo may theſe defects be amended, or encreaſed, theſe aptitudes improved or utterly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for men are not only as to theſe matters very different from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by Company, or Diet, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Education they may be altered from themſelves; a man is ſcarce the ſame thing when he is full and when he is faſting, when he is freſh in the morning and weary after the toyl and labour of the day, he hath
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:93763:23"/> not the ſame apprehenſion, and doth not make the ſame judgment of things when he is in drink and when he is ſober.</p>
            <p>When he is ſick and oppreſſed with a too heavy load of Melancholly and oppreſſive matter, when his blood does not circulate freely, or his ſtomach doth not perform its office, or the due and uſual ſeparations are not made by ſweat, or ſiege, or urine, he cannot diſcern things ſo clearly as at other times, he ſuſpects perſons without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and fears thoſe things of which he is in no danger, and he needs only to purge, or bleed, or enter into a Diet as a Phyſician ſhall preſcribe, to bring him to a ſound ſenſe and a right underſtanding both of himſelf and of the things about him: and ſo to conclude this matter, this is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that is to be given, why he that was a brisk and an active man in his
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:93763:24"/> youth, ſhall perhaps be a ſtupid Fellow and a dotard in his old age; others very dull and phlegmatick in their youth, do as they grow in years, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in briskneſs and in gayety too, why one that had a good underſtanding, ſhall loſe it by an accidental fall upon his head, and he that was dull and ſlow of apprehenſion, being ſoundly purged by a ſickneſs of the Small Pox ſhall grow more nimble and ſagacious then before.</p>
            <p>Wherefore this is the great duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon men, they are very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to watch, as over all their evil inclinations and unreaſonable deſires, ſo particularly over that which they find to be moſt reigning and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional in them, becauſe in <hi>this</hi> there is the greateſt danger, from this there is a ſtrong and a perpetual ſollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon <hi>this</hi> all opportunities and temptations from without have a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:93763:24"/> advantage, to this they find the moſt eaſie and favourable acceſs, and againſt <hi>this</hi> it is, whatever it be, that the Devil himſelf, who uſes his utmoſt diligence in watering the tares and cockle of our minds, that he may choak the wheat, and ſtifle the good ſeed, employes his moſt aſſiduous ſtratagems and devices, and with the moſt aſſured hopes of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>It concerns us therefore highly in oppoſition to ſo many and ſo great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies from within and from without, to ſtand perpetually upon our guard, and as we are to <hi>lay aſide every weight,</hi> and to ſubdue, as much as in us lies, every thought and affection to an obedience to reaſon and religion, ſo becauſe there is always the greateſt danger, and we are always the moſt ſtrongly ſollicited and aſſaulted on that ſide, we are therefore to have a more particular regard to the <hi>ſin that doth
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:93763:25"/> ſo eaſily beſet us,</hi> that is, to that particular ſin or folly whatſoever it be, which is moſt conſtitutional and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexional in us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as there are conſtitutional infirmities or vices, ſo there are alſo of the ſame kind certain natural perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or uſeful inclinations, which it ought to be every mans buſineſs for his own particular carefully to obſerve, and having obſerved to cultivate and improve, becauſe in the improvement of this talent, which is ſo natural to him, he will find himſelf moſt happy, he will be able to make the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable progreſs, and will be moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to himſelf and to Mankind.</p>
            <p>And though he be certainly the moſt happy man and the moſt highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of God and nature, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional talent ſhall conſiſt in that, which is of greateſt uſe and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the World, as if a man have
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:93763:25"/> a natural gravity and wiſdom in his looks, joyned to a natural ſobriety, and a ſtrong power of perſwaſion, which if employed in exhorting the world to virtue and calling it to repentance, and in ſpurring men on to a vigorous purſuit after things that are uſeful, praiſe-worthy, and of good example, will briug great authority and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to himſelf, and be of the moſt ſignal benefit and advantage to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Yet there are other Talents likewiſe, which though they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together of ſuch abſolute neceſſity or ſuch univerſal uſe, yet ought they wherever they are found to be with no leſs care and induſtry improved then the other, as if a mans parts lye for the improvement of Husbandry, Trade, Navigation, Mechanick arts, or any thing whereby life may be rendered more happy, ſociety more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental, Cities more wealthy, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:93763:26"/> more diffuſive, and the world, by every mans having where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to ſubſiſt, more ſafe; theſe are diſpoſitions wherever they are found, which are to be looked upon as the ſtock of nature, with which we are to ſet up as Citizens of the World, and for the improvement of which we muſt be accountable to God, from whom every good and perfect gift proceeds.]</p>
            <p>To which Conſiderations, for I went no farther upon that occaſion; it is to be added in the third place, that the reflecting upon this, that our very vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and excellencies themſelves are, in ſo great a meaſure, conſtitutional things, ought to be a natural remedy againſt all manner of inſolence and pride; for though it be a great ſhame to abuſe and adulterate an happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and the greateſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that can be to improve it, yet to be proud or inſolent becauſe our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:93763:26"/> are better made either for the practice of virtue or for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wiſdom then our neighbours, is to be proud of that which we could not avoid, and which it was not in our power to order otherwiſe then it is, and by conſequence is a very fooliſh, and very non-ſenſical pride.</p>
            <p>And then fourthly and laſtly, the reflecting upon the conſtitutional frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and imperfections, to which the nature of man is differently expoſed, which it is ſo hard and perhaps utterly impoſſible perfectly to conquer, and which are a degree of neceſſity ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced upon us from without, by the unmanageable temperament of our bodily part, ought to affect us all with a ſence of charity and pity for each other, and to ſtir us up to a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual forbearance of the ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities to which our natures are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; that is to ſay, we muſt ſo far
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:93763:27"/> bear with one another, as is conſiſtent with the peace of the world, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ought to endeavour ſo far as Religion and virtue will permit, to render his humour and his manners as agreeable as he can to thoſe with whom he converſes, for the greater comfort of Humane life, for the preſervation of friendſhip and charity in the world, and for the mutual benefit and advantage of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And now I ſee nothing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, which hath not been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently conſidered upon this Argument of Liberty and Neceſſity, either in this introduction, or in the book it ſelf, unleſs it be one of theſe three things, which I ſhall paſs over very briefly.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the caſe of the divine Preſcience which is pretended to be inconſiſtent with humane freedom. To which it is ſufficient to anſwer, that
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:93763:27"/> extend the foreknowledge of God as wide as you pleaſe, yet knowledge is but knowledge all this while, and can have no external Phyſical cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, for this were to confound the notions of knowledge and of power together; ſo that the only reaſon why there can be no ſuch thing as a free agent, is not becauſe this freedom is inconſiſtent with the divine Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which can have no Phyſical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon it, and there is no other influence in the nature of things; but becauſe the notion of a free agent conſidered by it ſelf, is an impoſſible notion, that is, it is impoſſible there ſhould be any ſuch thing as an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial being; for I have proved at large in one Part of this Diſcourſe, that an immaterial and a free agent are the ſame: and this being a point upon which all Religion depends, I leave the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> to conſider of it.</p>
            <pb n="l" facs="tcp:93763:28"/>
            <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt Freedom are objected, and thoſe Arguments, as I remember, for I have not his Book by me, are theſe two which follow; the firſt is contained in this ſyllogiſm. Every Cauſe is a ſufficient cauſe. Every ſufficient cauſe is a neceſſary cauſe. Therefore every cauſe is a neceſſary cauſe. Which is no more then to ſay in fewer words, Every cauſe is a cauſe. Which being an <hi>Identical</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition muſt needs be true, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is a cauſe till it have produced an effect, and then indeed it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the effect ſhould have been, becauſe that which is paſt can never be to come; but yet it does not follow but that there might be a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality or cauſability, reſiding in a ſubject or ſubſtance though it do not yet exert it ſelf by any expreſs or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual operation; and Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> in
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:93763:28"/> this ſence might have been ſaid to be a cauſe of the <hi>Leviathan</hi> and the book <hi>de Cive</hi> many years before he wrote the Books themſelves.</p>
            <p>His ſecond argument is taken from the nature of a disjunctive propoſition concerning an action which is ſuppoſed to be future and contingent; as thus. Either <hi>Socrates</hi> ſhall diſpute to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or he ſhall not diſpute to morrow; and it is certain that this Propoſition is unqueſtionably true, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of contradicting parts, which contain the whole circuit of things within themſelves; for everything in the world beſides <hi>diſputing</hi> is <hi>not diſputing,</hi> and if <hi>Socrates</hi> ſhould <hi>dye</hi> or ſhould be <hi>annihilated</hi> to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, yet <hi>to be annihilated</hi> or <hi>to dye</hi> is <hi>not to diſpute,</hi> ſo that the whole Propoſition is unavoidably true, but it does not follow that either of its
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:93763:29"/> parts are ſo determinately at this time, and that was Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> his miſtake, as I will prove by altering the Propoſition a very little. Either <hi>Socrates</hi> ſhall diſpute freely to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or he ſhall not diſpute freely. Now the nature of a Disjunctive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is this, that all the parts taken aſunder, cannot be true at the ſame time; becauſe they are ſuppoſed to be incompetible and inconſiſtent with one another, otherwiſe there is no disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: further, it is certain that there can but one part of a Disjunctive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which concerns the <hi>preſent</hi> be true at the ſame time, and in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <hi>de futuro</hi> there can be but one part eventually true; but this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the nature of the thing, and upon the iſſue of the expected event, not upon the nature of the Propoſition, to which it is neceſſary
<pb n="liii" facs="tcp:93763:29"/> that it ſhould conſiſt of ſeveral parts, and therefore the truth of it as ſuch, muſt depend upon the juſt and full enumeration of all thoſe parts of which it ought to conſiſt, ſo that whatever becomes of the nature of the thing, the Disjunctive Propoſition hinders not but <hi>Socrates</hi> may be free, ſince freedom is ſuppoſed in one of its members, but yet if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he ſhall diſpute freely to morrow, as Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> muſt own, if he will be conſiſtent to himſelf, then he will be free and neceſſary at the ſame time, which is abſurd.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt thing which may be, and is uſually objected, concerns thoſe places of Scripture, wherein the days of a man are ſaid to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and the time of every reſpective perſonalities continuance upon the earth predetermined and preordained, which
<pb n="liv" facs="tcp:93763:30"/> if it be true, then it will follow una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably that the actions of a mans life are neceſſary and fatal, for there may be a thouſand ſeveral actions that may conſpire to bring a man into a Chronical diſtemper, which ſhall be the cauſe of his death; if he be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined to dye at ſuch a time of the Plague, it muſt likewiſe be ſo ordered, that he ſhall neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide there where it is, or repair thither that he may catch it: and if his fate be to be knockt on the head by the fall of any Stone or Timber from an Houſe, it is neceſſary that he be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and paſſing by that place where the Stone or Timber may be ſure to meet him in its fall, and the like. But I do abſolutely deny that the days of a man are any where in Scripture affirmed to be thus limited or prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; but that which is called
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:93763:30"/> the <hi>appointed time,</hi> is the utmoſt diſtance of time from the day of a mans birth to which the <hi>ſtamina vitae</hi> will extend, or to which the reſpective conſtitutions will laſt, if they be well uſed; and what that time is, God certainly who is the Author of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and hath all cauſes and effects perpetually preſent to him and always in his ſight, cannot chuſe but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand very well: but yet it does not follow, but a man may anticipate this time by intemperance, or by want of skill, or want of care; nay, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we may affirm it for a certain truth, that no man ever did yet live ſo long, as he might poſſibly have done, had he underſtood his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and the reſpective uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or annoyance of all other things to it, together with the true propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in which they are to be taken
<pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:93763:31"/> and avoided, and had he lived a life an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to ſo exact a knowledge; and yet after all, humane life would be but of ſhort continuance, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all we ſhould have reaſon to pray with the Prophet <hi>David, that God would teach us to know our end and the number of our days, that we might apply our hearts unto wiſdom;</hi> that is, that he would teach us to reflect upon the ſhortneſs of our lives and the frailty of our natures, that we might improve that little time we have here to the beſt advantage. And this I think is a ſufficient anſwer to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verovicius</hi> his Queſtion, <hi>An ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus vitae ſit mobilis,</hi> without all that laborious canvaſſing of the buſineſs, which is to be found in the Epiſtles of thoſe Learned men, who at his requeſt undertook a reſolution of that Problem, eſpecially <hi>Voetius</hi> and <hi>Salmaſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:93763:31"/>
            <p>I have nothing further to add, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be, that I would deſire the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts to conſider ſeriouſly with themſelves, whether they who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim ſo loudly againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which I believe as well as they to be an <hi>Idolatrous Church,</hi> are not guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for they worſhip an Angry, Revengeful, and Implacable Being, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Merciful and Gracious Nature, a Raſh and Cruel Deity, inſtead of a Wiſe and Juſt, which if I underſtand any thing, is to direct their worſhip to a falſe Object; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the attributes of God are not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinct from God himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to worſhip falſe Attributes muſt be of neceſſity to worſhip a falſe God. However I am very tender of charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Idolatry, eſpecially ſince they pretend to hate and deteſt it ſo
<pb n="lviii" facs="tcp:93763:32"/> much; only I deſire them to conſider of it, and I cannot forbear declaring thus much, that I think it is to no purpoſe to worſhip the <hi>God of the Calviniſts</hi> who cannot be moved from his Decrees by any Prayers or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, and who if he be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of any good to us in this life, or of any happineſs to any of us in that which is to come, yet it is not out of any Principle of goodneſs in his nature, but purely out of an Arbitrary determination of his mind, and, in plain Engliſh, an unaccountable humour.</p>
            <p>I have referred towards the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of theſe Papers to an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,</hi> which I deſigned concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Extenſion of the Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but I have conſidered that queſtion very largely in ſome other Papers, wherein I have attempted
<pb n="lix" facs="tcp:93763:32"/> an explanation of the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which I intend, when I have reviewed, to publiſh.</p>

            </head>
            <p>I Am ſo well perſwaded of the truth of what I have written, and of the honeſty of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in writing it, that I ſhall need to make no other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for its Publication, than that I conceive, it might be uſeful to the world; and I hope, the event will prove that I was not miſtaken.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of thoſe Texts of Scripture, wherein God is ſaid to have hardened, or blinded, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived men, is the ſubject of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe, as it has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93763:34"/> to very little purpoſe of many larger Volumes; while ſome are ſo nice that they will not allow in any of theſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> any more than a divine Permiſſion, by leaving men wholly to the conduct and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their own unruly Paſſions, and corrupt Affections, and to the blaſting influences of degenerate and wicked Spirits. And others are ſo hardy as to aſcribe all to the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will of God, founded upon no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but a boundleſs Soveraignty and dominion over all things.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe is ſo dilute and cold a way of interpreting thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where ſo much of activity and poſitive Concurrence ſeems plainly to be aſcribed to God; that if ſuch activity can poſſibly be reconciled to the common notions which we are uſed to entertain of the divine nature and attributes, and to the ſtanding meaſures of truth, goodneſs and juſtice: It ought by no means to be admitted, becauſe ſuch a way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation when there is no need, does inſtead of doing good, do a great deal of miſchief in the world, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93763:34"/> the Scripture to be more obſcure than it is, and by that means giving too much encouragement to the wild Interpretations of Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick or deſigning men. Whereas the Scripture being the univerſal law of Life, the ſtanding rule of faith and practice amongſt men, that it may be the more effectual to thoſe good purpoſes for which it was deſigned; it ought to be rendred as plain and intelligible as may be, neither ought we ever to recur to a figurative ſenſe; ſo as for example, when ſuch or ſuch an action, or ſuch or ſuch an effect is aſcribed to God, in Scripture, to ſay that he only permits that action to be done, or that effect to come to paſs, unleſs where the literal and firſt meaning will not do.</p>
            <p>But yet notwithſtanding this way of interpretation, how weak and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſoever it be in its ſelf, which I think, I have abundantly diſcovered in the following papers: Yet being made uſe of upon pious reaſons to ſalve the credit of the divine Juſtice and goodneſs, and to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of God more uniſone and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93763:35"/> agreeable to the natural reaſon of men, it is our duty not to decline it without a becoming Reverence; and to treat the Authours or abettors of it with all imaginable reſpect and Honour.</p>
            <p>But as for that other way which reſolves all into the arbitrary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, who is according to theſe men a very arbitrary Being, and damns his Creatures in the other world with as little reaſon as he hardens them in this, it is an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo horrid, and ſo impious, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to the honour of God, ſo expreſly levell'd againſt the happineſs of men, attended on all hands with ſuch diſmal conſequences of inevitable Ruin and Deſpair, that if it could not be avoided but this muſt needs be granted to be the natural ſenſe and only true meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in thoſe places which either one way or other do concern this point. I ſhould think it my duty to renounce and abominate that Book wherein ſuch prodigious Doctrines were contained, not only ſo deſtructive to the intereſt, but ſo contrary to

            <p>Now if an expedient can be found out, by which both of the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned inconveniences ſhall be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which may conſiſt with a more natural and eaſie way of expounding Scripture, which will do no violence to the attributes of God, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſentiments of mankind; which ſhall make Religion to be at once an intelligible and highly reaſonable thing, and ſhall at once vindicate it from the ſcoffs of Atheiſts, who are its profeſſed Enemies, and from the reproaches of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> who are its pretended Friends: I hope to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſo wholeſome and ſafe a paſſage between two dangerous extreams, by both of which the Authority of the Scripture ſuffers; by the one from the obſcurity, or rather downright Inconſiſtency of its expreſſions to the nature of the things intended to be ſignified by them; and by the other

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93763:41"/> already, that there is nothing more common among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> than this, and that all our Prieſts can do the ſame, at which immediately the Magicians threw down their Rods, which were converted preſently into Serpents like that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and gave new ſtrength to the obſtinacy of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the two rational mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives upon which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The Firſt was properly a reaſon of State, and intereſt why he ſhould not ſuffer the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to depart.</p>
            <p>The Second was an argument with him and his people, not to give that credit to the miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> which otherwiſe they might have done.</p>

            <p>For when the rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> had ſwallowed thoſe of the Magicians, which was a ſufficient teſtimony of a Power ſuperiour to theirs, yet he makes the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> inſenſible of any ſuch thing. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p>Again, whereas I have compared
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93763:42"/> this hardneſs of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart to a Lethargick or Apoplectick fit, which is awakened ſometimes into ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſenſation by the application of Cauſtick and painful Remedies; but frequently upon the abatement of that Pain, relapſes into its former ſecurity and forgetful Slumber, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was frequently of the mind to yield to the preſſing importunity of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when it was backed with the dreadful ſollicitation of the moſt diſmal Plagues, but yet upon the leaſt relaxation or intermiſſion of thoſe Plagues, was juſt the ſame inſenſible and ſtupid Creature that ever he was before. I am in this likewiſe very ſtrongly ſupported by the Authority of the ſame <hi>Joſephus,</hi> of the Rivers being turned into blood, and of the removal of that Calamity he ſays thus. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p>So likewiſe when the Plague of Frogs was by the Mercy of God at the Prayer of <hi>Moſes</hi> removed, he makes him to have been ſo ſtupid, that he was no more moved than if no ſuch Judgment had ever been inflicted, his words are theſe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

And why does <hi>Curcelleus</hi> allow it to have been done in the inſtance of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar?</hi> And if it be, then why ſhould we ſeek a thouſand ſhifts and evaſions to elude the force and evidence of other Texts, that ſpeak as plainly and as broadly as thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſtory of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is told?</p>

And though I deſign to bring him to that paſs by my Judgments, that he ſhall not dare to detain my people any longer; yet becauſe it will be only by force and againſt his will, that he will at laſt ſuffer them to depart: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will give him an occaſion, of which he ſhall be ſure to take hold, that having the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at a great advantage, hem'd in on one ſide by the Mountains, and on the other by the Red-Sea, being undiſciplin'd, and unarm'd, unable either to fly or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; he ſhall purſue them with an obſtinate and revengful mind, through the Channel of the Red-Sea, whither
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93763:47"/> when I have brought him as it were into a Theatre, upon a publick Stage, I will make him a notorious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to all Mankind, and will puniſh him with that ſeverity, which ſo much Cruelty and ſo much obſtinate perverſneſs have deſerved.</p>
            <p>This is all that <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> will be brought to ſay, but if you conſider how favourable he is in other parts of his writings, to thoſe who deny God's preſcience of future Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it amounts in a manner to as much, as if he had ſpoken as broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>Curcelleus</hi> afterwards did.</p>
            <p>Again, he acknowledges that God gave an occaſion which he knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would be ſure to embrace, that is, that he perſwaded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to go by the way of the Red-Sea, as he did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 2.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93763:48"/> a neceſſity of following them in order to his final overthrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>The laſt Evidence I ſhall produce to corroborate what I have written, ſhall be taken from the words of the late excellently learned and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily pious Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> in his little Tract concerning a Death-Bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, where diſcourſing concerning this very inſtance of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> after much canvaſing of the Buſineſs in favour of thoſe, who will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that Doctrine which I have laid down to be true, he concludes thus, p. 16.</p>
            <p>The reſult of all that I have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lay down concerning <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is this, that although his State were a long time but reverſibly ill, as long as he <hi>hardened his own heart;</hi> yet when his own obdurations were come to the fulneſs of meaſure, and he ripe and dropping into Hell; as after the ſixth Judgment he was: then God exchanged the firſt part of that due puniſhment of his in another world, that was inſtantly to have Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for a temporary cooler Hell
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93763:48"/> here; <hi>hardened his heart,</hi> and obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all poſſibility of Repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from him, and ſo concluded him in this life in an irreverſible Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Which notion he afterwards im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves to the ſame purpoſes that I have done, and after ſome further diſcourſe upon this occaſion, <hi>p.</hi> 18. He concludes thus: All which being not only granted, but propoſed as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſiderations to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with this Doctrine; it remains ſtill clear and uncontrouled, that God may, if he will, thus puniſh a hard heart with total and final ſubſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Grace, and ſo with hardening irreverſibly, either here, which I only ſay he may, but know not that he will; or at the hour of Death, at which time there is no doubt but he will thus proceed with every impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent.</p>
            <p>I account my ſelf very happy in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving jumped ſo exactly in my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of things, with ſo famous and renowned a Champion of our Church, and I was the more pleaſed in the firſt of theſe Citations to find not only the notion, but the very
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93763:49"/> words in which it is expreſſed to come ſo near to ſome of mine in the following Diſcourſe, though I had not the good fortune to ſee Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's</hi> Treatiſe till near two Months after I had written mine; when upon ſhowing what I had written, to a worthy Friend, to have his opinion of it, he was pleaſed to communicate that piece of the Doctors to me, which, when I found it ſo agreeable to mine own thoughts; you may well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine I read it with abundance of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>But ſtill there is ſome ſmall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the learned Doctor and me. He, as I do humbly conceive, out of a needleſs tenderneſs for the Honour of God, and for the Glory of his attributes, to make his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and forbearance with us the more remarkable and conſpicuous, will not admit of this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure till the laſt caſt, when the man is grown deſperate, and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in vain to expect any amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him; nay, he will not poſitively determine whether ever God do viſit men with final impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93763:49"/> till the hour of Death. But it is very clear that whatever God may lawfully do without any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to his Juſtice, that he may do at all times, whenever there is a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or juſtifiable occaſion: ſince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is confeſſed on all hands, that God may and does oftentimes take away Sinners in the middeſt of their days by a particular Judgment, the conſequence of which without all queſtion is inevitable Damnation; why may he not as well harden and blind men ſooner or later, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf, into an irreverſible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, ſo as it ſhall be impoſſible for them to Repent, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them on this ſide the Grave, to be the publick examples of his Juſtice to the world? For no man can be any more than Damned, and therefore with reſpect to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf; theſe are but two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtances of the ſame rightful do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Soveraignty over us, which may take the forfeiture of our Sins either way, and at what time it ſhall ſeem beſt to the ſupream Lord, and uncontroulable proprietor of all things.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:93763:50"/>
            <p>It is true indeed the common im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which are ſo deeply rooted in us all concerning the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the daily experience we have of his infinite Goodneſs, in the adminiſtration of this lower world, will not permit us to think that God will do either of theſe without very great provocations, but we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that all men are not equally ripe for puniſhment at the ſame time or age; there is great difference as to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repetition of Sin, as to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent enormity or heinouſneſs of the Crimes committed, and as to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent aggravation of thoſe circumſtances under which they are committed; one man ſins againſt greater convictions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter greater Mercies, under more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Influences of the holy Spirit than another, and theſe things would make a vaſt difference as to the time of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting puniſhment, though the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice were always to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, <hi>ad pondus,</hi> and did always hold the ſame proportion to the Sins of men: but then it is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſecond place, that God is not bound to extend the ſame pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93763:50"/> to all, nor indeed ſo much to any as he does; but in ſome he may take the forfeiture of their Sins ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in ſome later as he pleaſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which whoever ſhall ſeriouſly reflect upon, will find it a Doctrine not only very reaſonable in it ſelf, but in its Conſequences ſo wholeſome that nothing can be more.</p>
            <p>For what greater Inducement can there poſſibly be to an holy and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life, to care and watchfulneſs in all our Converſation, than to think that we are every moment upon our good behaviour; and that God if we continue to provoke him any longer, may the next minute ſeal our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Doom, and conſign us over to eternal Flames, may put us into an irrecoverable State of degeneracy and Apoſtacy in this life, that we may be made a Spectacle of ſhame and horrour in this world, and an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal prey to infinite and everlaſting Torments in the next. Certainly if this one Conſideration were but throughly impreſſed upon the minds of men, there is nothing in the world that could have better effects, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93763:51"/> a more laſting or a more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reformation in it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as you cannot well, if you reflect upon the Circumſtances of moſt men, enlarge this power of obduration in God, ſo far as to make the exerciſe of it unjuſt; ſo the farther you do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it with conſiſtency to reaſon, and Juſtice, the better effects it will produce, and the greater advantages will be reaped from it.</p>
            <p>There are indeed two things which have made many learned and pious Perſons cautious of admitting ſo much as I have done.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Leſt God by this means ſhould be looked upon as the Author of Sin, and therefore as the only way in their opinion, to avoid this inconvenience, they generally interpret all thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only of a divine permiſſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which indeed it is impoſſible any Action ſhould be done or any event come to paſs; becauſe upon his will and power the very exiſtence of all things does depend, <hi>in him we live and move, and have our being;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he did not ſometimes permit at leaſt, and ſuffer bad things to be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93763:51"/> done, no ſuch thing could ever come to paſs, beſides that a divine permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of abſolute neceſſity to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being of virtue and true Religion in the world; for if men could not Act otherwiſe than they do, they could not be ſaid to be either good or bad: and therefore that men may uſe that freedom which is given them aright, it is neceſſary they ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have a power of determining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves another way. To be ſure with reſpect to this life this muſt be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be unavoidably true; for what is our whole life but a perpetual warefare with bad deſires from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, with importuning Temptations from without, with our own frailties, and with the Solicitations of others, and with the crafty inveiglements of the Devil, who will be ſure to accoſt us on that ſide, which is weakeſt and leaſt defenſible in us, by motives of Pleaſure, profit, applauſe or Power; or whatever elſe he ſhall judge moſt likely to prevail upon us? But now, I beſeech you, who is there, or who ever was there, or will ever be of humane race, ſo perfectly pure and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93763:52"/> untainted, that he could not yeild to the importunity of any Temptation? or what Combate could there be if he could not reſiſt?</p>
            <p>Beſides it is neceſſary there ſhould be ſuch a thing as the Schools are pleaſed to call <hi>libertatem contrarietatis,</hi> a liberty of determining either way in an Action or Caſe given, one of which ſaid determinations ſhall be Culpable, the other meritorious or praiſeworthy; becauſe to ſuppoſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, is to deprive the divine Juſtice of any Foundation, to exerciſe it ſelf upon. Juſtice in the perſon puniſhing, and liberty in the perſon offending, do naturally ſuppoſe one another: for to Condemn one who could not avoid what he did, or to reward ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who could not ſo much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to merit what he enjoys, may be called Arbitrary, but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be juſt. For what Judgment is there where there is no difference? And what Juſtice can there be where there is no Judgment, made of the merit of the perſons that appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it?</p>
            <p>Both of which reaſons of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93763:52"/> permiſſion of Sin, are excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pointed at by an ancient Writer, publiſhed among the works of <hi>Juſtin Martyr.</hi>

               </gap> that is, God permits us to commit thoſe evils, which we wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chuſe, not that he is not able to hinder it, but becauſe we have a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of doing otherwiſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this means he diſplays his own patience and forbearance with us.</p>
            <p>But yet notwithſtanding though it be true, that God does and muſt be ſuppoſed to permit Sin in the world, yet to interpret all thoſe places which are the Subject of our preſent debate only of a bare Permiſſion, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very harſh and uncouth, to any that ſhall peruſe the places them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, wherein a great deale more than this ſeems manifeſtly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and is aſcribed to God in as plain words as it is poſſible for any Language to ſpeak: Beſides that it is needleſs to the deſign for which it is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93763:53"/> done, becauſe neceſſity deſtroys the nature of Sin; and juſt ſo much as there is of freedom in any Action, ſo much of moral good or evil there may be in it, but no more; he that is neceſſitated is paſſive in what he does, neither are thoſe Actions which he commits in ſuch a ſtate to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as his, but they are the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Agent by whom he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is Acted. The caſe is this, one man kills another lying in wait for him out of Malice, forethought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he bore him a grudge and had vow'd Revenge; or being in a cooler humour than this, he does it out of a wicked frolick, reſolving for a jeſt to kill the next man he meets, now it ſo happens that this man himſelf is afterwards deſtroyed by the goring of a mad Bull in his paſſage through the Streets, or by the fall of a Beam from an Houſe, all on fire or the like; here is the ſame event on both hands, a man kill'd; but yet to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the one there is a guilt belonging, to the other there is not, what is the reaſon of this? why the reaſon is plain, becauſe the firſt is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93763:53"/> the effect of a free, the latter of a neceſſary Agent. If therefore a man by ſome external impulſe be ſo far overrul'd that he is not himſelf, his Actions are not his own neither, but he is in the nature and quality of the mad Bull or the Beam, he does theſe things becauſe he cannot help it; and therefore they are no Sins. Or if ſometimes there be a Complexion of the free Cauſe, and of the neceſſary together, as I have ſhown there may be, yet the common Action reſulting from them both, partakes only of ſo much guilt, as it borrows of Cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from the Free. It is impoſſible therefore that God ſhould be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of Sin in any other Senſe, than as he is the Authour of that freedom by virtue of which we commit it: but yet to ſpeak properly, it is not the freedom it ſelf which is the cauſe of Sin, but it is the abuſe of that freedom which is wholly owing to our ſelves, and God is no otherwiſe concurring to it, than as a <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> in as much as we could not have ſinned if we had not abuſed our freedom; and we could not have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93763:54"/> our freedom, if God had not made us free. From all which it appears that to talk of God's being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of Sin in men, is to talk not only <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, things that are utterly impoſſible to be done. For my part I am ſo far from favouring any ſuch opinion, that if any man ſhould by way of excuſe lay his Sins to the charge of God Almighty, as neceſſitating him to what he did, I think it is a plain Argument he is ſenſible of his having done amiſs, and conſequently might have done better if he had pleaſed, and ſhall therefore very heartily joyn in. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's</hi> imprecation againſt him. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93763:54"/> for ſuch as do humbly acknowledge and bewail them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon, if indeed it may be called a ſecond, and be not rather the ſame, why ſome have been ſo extreamly ſcrupulous in the interpretation of ſuch places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as are now under Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to be taken from their deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved hatred and utter Abomination, of Calviniſtical Doctrines, by which God is repreſented to be ſo cruel and ſanguinary a being; but the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe texts according to their firſt and moſt natural ſenſe, is ſo far from bordering upon Calviniſm, that it perfectly deſtroyes it, ſince every ſuch Text is a new Argument for the liberty of the humane nature and will, in as much as it would be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to ſay God hardens or blinds men by a particular Judgment, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that in their natural and beſt Eſtate, they had neither the uſe of their reaſon, nor the liberty of their will.</p>

Nay, when the fables of the Heathen Poets do tell us ſuch incredible Sto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Scylla, Chimaera, Hydra,</hi> and the Centaures, of men transformed into Birds, and Beaſts, and Flowers, and Trees, and Stars, and Stones, what wonder is it, if God to give a demonſtration of his own infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and withall to humble the pride and inſolence of haughty Kings, ſhould work ſo great a change as this by transforming <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> nto one of the Beaſts of the Field?

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93763:56"/> hath not yet that I know of been ſufficiently explained by any Interpreter whatſoever, ſeems to me to beas follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> had behaved himſelf with that Pride, Inſolence, and Tyranny towards his Subjects, oppreſſing them without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſenſe of humanity or regard to Juſtice, and forgetting from whom, and to what purpoſes he had received his Power, that God gave him over as a Prey to the Pride and Haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own mind, inſomuch that he began now, not only to oppreſs the meaner Herd as he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but to exerciſe his Cruelty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great ones themſelves: thoſe that had been the former Partners, and Aſſociates with him in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions and Severities upon the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort; wherefore as in a common Calamity they all agreed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him no longer for their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, but inſtead of that they drove him from men, that is, they depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from his Royal Throne to dwell with the Beaſts of the Field, and to eat Graſs as Oxen, that is, they had no more regard of him than as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93763:57"/> of an ordinary perſon, or fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with them.</p>
            <p>This is the meaning of <hi>Dan. 4. v. 16. Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a Beaſt's heart be given unto him,</hi> that is, let him be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of his reaſonable or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, <hi>and let a Beaſt's heart be given unto him,</hi> that is, let him be given up as a Prey to the Exorbitant fury of his Paſſions, and let thoſe Paſſions be improved into all manner of ſavage Rapaciouſneſs and Cruelty, as in Carnivorous animals and Beaſts that live by preying upon their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; and it is ſaid <hi>let a Beaſt's heart be given unto him,</hi> becauſe the heart is the ſeat of the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed the ſeat of Anger and Revenge and of all the iraſcible Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Soul.</p>
            <p>The ſame is likewiſe the true and undoubted Interpretation of his hairs being grown <hi>like Eagles feathers, and his Nails like Birds Claws, v.</hi> 32. For it is manifeſt theſe things can never be underſtood in the literal Senſe; for what a Monſter would this make of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> betwixt a wild
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93763:57"/> Beaſt and a ravenous Bird, <hi>that had the heart of a Beaſt, and eat graſs as Oxen, having his body wet with the dew of Heaven; his hairs grown like Eagles feathers; and his Nails like Birds Claws?</hi> But if you apply all theſe things which are ſo perfectly inconſiſtent with one another, to denote the inflamation of his paſſions into all manner of exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitance and exceſs, there will be at leaſt a ſymbolical agreement and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony between them, inaſmuch as the do all very properly conſpire to denote ſuch a cruel and revengeful temper.</p>
            <p>Which things being ſo very true and ſo very plain, and being a part and conſequence of that divine Judgment, which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaw more dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Viſion; and <hi>Daniel</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards declared to be hanging over his head, and which he adviſed him to avert; or at leaſt wiſe to procraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate by an early Repentance: what can be more evident from all this, than that ſuch events do ſometimes come to paſs, not meerly by the bare permiſſion, but by the immediate hand of God, and by a poſitive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93763:58"/> of the divine will, or as the words of the Viſion have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it in a more prophetick Stile, <hi>by the decree of the Watchers, and by the word of the Holy ones, v.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That by <hi>eating graſs as Oxen,</hi> is meant his being levell'd with the ordinary crowd of men, deveſted of all his Royal Majeſty and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſhall now make out as plainly as I have the other, for I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to impoſe my own Fancies upon any man, any farther than they ſhall appear to be conſonant to reaſon, and ſo far they will ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without any ſollicitude or care of mine. <hi>Dan. 4. v.</hi> 12, we find theſe words of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> Tree, <hi>The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: The Beaſts of the Field had ſhadow under it, and the Fowles of the Heaven dwelt in the Boughs thereof, and all fleſh was fed of it,</hi> and what was meant by this Tree, we find expreſly ſet down by <hi>Daniel, v. 20, 21, 22. The Tree that thou ſaweſt which grew and was ſtrong, whoſe height reached unto the Heaven, and the ſight thereof to all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93763:58"/> the Earth, whoſe leaves were fair, and the Fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all, under which the Beaſts of the Field dwelt, and upon whoſe Branches the Fowles of the Heaven had their habitation. It is thou, O King, that art grown and become ſtrong: For thy greatneſs is grown, and reacheth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, and thy Dominion to the end of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the King be this great Tree, then nothing is more clear than that by the <hi>Birds of Heaven that dwelt in the Boughs thereof, and by the Beaſts of the Field that, had ſhadow under it</hi> his Subjects muſt be underſtood, (unleſs you will ſuppoſe him to have been a King of Birds and Beaſts inſtead of men) and if ſo then by the Fowles of Heaven, we are to underſtand the Nobles, Grandees, and Magiſtrates, the Miniſters of State, and Officers of publick Juſtice belonging to his Kingdom. Theſe are ſaid to have dwelt in the Boughs thereof, that is, to approach nigher to the Honour and Majeſty of the ſupream Lord, and ſtill as every man's dignity or Office is greater than that of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93763:59"/> his rooſt upon this Imperial and ſymbolick Tree approaches nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the top of it.</p>
            <p>Again, by the ſame way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Fowles of Heaven are the great men, the Beaſts of the Field are the populace, or common crowd of his Subjects, and theſe are ſaid to have ſhadow under this Tree; as all Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties and Bodies of men in the world owe their Security and defence to the protection of the ſupream Power, and in acknowledgment of this defence, and of the advantages accruing to themſelves, and their Poſterities by it, they are to pay a ſuitable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſubmiſſion to that ſupream Authority from whence they receive it.</p>
            <p>And therefore when this Tree was to be cut down: <hi>v. 13. 14. When the Watcher and the Holy one came down from Heaven, and cry'd aloud and ſaid thus, hew down the Tree, and cut off its branches, ſhake off his leaves, and ſcatter his fruit;</hi> that is, let this King be deprived of his imperial Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Power: It is added immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, <hi>let the Beaſts get away from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93763:59"/> it, and the Fowles from under its branches,</hi> that is, all the people as well the Commonalty, as the Nobleſs, are for the preſent excuſed from all Duty and Allegiance to him, ſo long as he continues to exerciſe his Power only by acts of Cruelty and Tyrannick Madneſs, to the utter Ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>Now why may not theſe Beaſts be the ſame with thoſe that are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called Oxen, with whom <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> is ſaid to have eaten Graſs, for it is plain, there was Graſs under this prophetick Tree; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they might Graze as much and as often as they pleaſed? for it is ſaid <hi>v. 15. Nevertheleſs leave the ſtump of his roots in the Earth, even with a band of Iron and Braſs, in the tender Graſs of the Field,</hi> and then it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſubjoyned. <hi>Let it be wet with the dew of Heaven,</hi> that is, let him be expoſed to the hardſhips and uncertainties of Chance and Fortune, <hi>and let his portion be with the Beaſts in the Graſs of the Earth,</hi> that is, let him not exerciſe any more Authority, Dominion, or Kingly power, than
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93763:60"/> any ordinary or private man, than the Beaſts of the people as the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> in the mixt tranſlation ſomewhere calls them, than the very meaneſt of all his own Subjects and Vaſſals. So then he that was to eat Graſs with Oxen in an other part of this Chapter, was here to have his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Beaſts in the Graſs of the Earth, and <hi>v.</hi> 25, they are put together; <hi>thy dwelling ſhall be with the Beaſts of the Field, and they ſhall make thee to eat Graſs as Oxen:</hi> Therefore they are both the ſame, but I have proved that by the Beaſts of the Field the common Crowd of mankind are to be underſtood; therefore it muſt needs be, that by having his portion with them in the Graſs, and by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Graſs as Oxen, muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, the being reduced to an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Condition with them. This is not Fancy but Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>Again it is no leſs plain from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of Scripture as well as this, that by Oxen in the prophetick or ſymbolick ſtile the groſs of mankind are ſignified, as in <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Dream of the ſeven fat and lean Kine, the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93763:60"/> ſeven plump and blaſted Ears, theſe were not two ſeveral Declarations of the ſame thing, as in the ſynchroniſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Viſions of the Revelation; but they were two partial Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of one and the ſame entire event, which was afterwards to come to paſs. The thin and full Ears, ſignifi'd the plenty and ſcarcity of all ſorts of Grain; the number Seven, pointed at the duration of each of theſe for the continuance of ſeven Years; and the Kine were the People or Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the neighbouring Countries, who were to enjoy this Plenty, or were in likelyhood of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pinch'd and famiſh'd under the ſad effects of ſcarcity and want.</p>
            <p>So in the building of <hi>Solomon's</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Molten-Sea was contrived <hi>to ſtand upon twelve Oxen, 1 Kings, c. 7. v.</hi> 25. with alluſion to the twelve Tribes, not reckoning the tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> who had no portion nor Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among them; as the Ark when it was an Ambulatory thing, was uſed to be carried to and fro by the <hi>Levites,</hi> which <hi>Levites</hi> did repreſent the firſt-Born of the twelve Tribes.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93763:61"/> And thus likewiſe <hi>under the brim</hi> of the Molten-Sea, <hi>there were knops com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing it, ten in a Cubit round about 1 Kings, c. 7. v.</hi> 24. Which knops. 2 <hi>Chron. c. 4. v.</hi> 3. are called <hi>Oxen,</hi> but much ſmaller it ſeems they were than thoſe twelve already mentioned. Now of theſe Knops or Oxen, there being ten in a Cubit, and the Molten-Sea, being in Circumference thirty Cubits, it is manifeſt there muſt be three hundred of theſe Oxen, that is five and twenty times twelve, ſtill with a myſtical alluſion to the twelve Tribes, of which the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was compoſed.</p>
            <p>Thus I have proved by more argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than one, that by Oxen in the language of the Scripture, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon crowd of men are ſometimes denoted; and by their eating Graſs, the lowneſs of the plebeian or vulgar fortune is ſignified, as is both reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in its ſelf to believe, and is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently intimated in the ſtory it ſelf, <hi>v. 15. Leave the ſtump of his roots in the Earth, even with a band of Iron and Braſs, in the tender Graſs of the Field,</hi> the plain ſenſe of which is, do
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93763:61"/> not let him be perfectly rooted out, but let him be brought as low as can be: <hi>Let him feed on Graſs as Beaſts do,</hi> which is an argument of the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Condition, according to thoſe known Verſes of <hi>Ovid.</hi>

            <p>And now from this ſtory of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> thus evidently and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained, give me leave to ſtep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide into theſe following remarks or Obſervations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That when I ſay he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by his people, I mean no more, neither is there indeed any more in the truth of the thing it ſelf, than that the Adminiſtration of affairs by reaſon of his extream madneſs and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93763:62"/> incapacity to govern, was put into other hands, of one or more, but it is probable, in the Eaſt where Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy was the only form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of one; and he as it ſeems, of the meaneſt of all the people, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen perhaps by ſuch another trick as <hi>Darius</hi> is ſaid to have been, <hi>v. 17. The moſt High ruleth in the Kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will, and ſetteth up over it the baſeſt of men;</hi> which in the language of an Heathen is as much as to ſay,</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Valet ima ſummis</l>
               <l>Mutare, &amp; inſignem attenuat Deus,</l>
               <l>Obſcura promens—</l>
            </q>
            <p>But yet notwithſtanding, they did no otherwiſe diſobey <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> their lawful Soveraign, than by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to comply with him, or lend their helping hand to the executing his moſt unjuſt and barbarous Decrees; of which, no doubt he gave many lamentable inſtances, before any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Obedience was denied him, and one of them we have no farther off, than in the Chapter immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93763:62"/> where all are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded through all his ſpatious Provinces and large Dominions to be caſt into the Fiery-Furnace, that would not fall down and worſhip the golden Image which he had ſet up: A Decree ſo ſtrangely Tyrannical, and inhumane that it is an equal wonder that there ſhould any where be found ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Prince as to enjoyn, or ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved and miſerable Subjects as dare not refuſe in ſuch a caſe to obey ſo ſavage and ſo impious a Decree.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond thing which I ſhall obſerve, is that being deveſted of all Power, and that Madneſs which was the cauſe of it, being by this means improved to a greater height; there is no doubt but while he was in this Condition, he did with his own hand commit many great and horrid outrages, though he could not find any body to aſſiſt him, but all were either weary, or afraid of being any longer the Executioners of his wicked Commands.</p>
            <p>But yet Thirdly, It is plain, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, that his perſon e mained ſacred and inviolate, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93763:63"/> was any man ſuffered to hurt or annoy him, for the ſpace, as is probable, of at leſt ſeven Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; which Religious care of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no manner of violence to the Majeſty of Princes, which is next to that of God, would without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have laſted longer, if the hand of God had continued any longer upon him, which is a notable example of that ſtrange Veneration which the Liege men of old time did uſe to pay their natural and rightful Soveraigns, and what an awe and dread they had for that Character which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from God, and that unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Authority with which they were by him inveſted.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, No ſooner did he return to himſelf, and the heavy hand of God being removed from him, began to have a ſenſe of his former Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and to recover the uſe of his reaſon, <hi>Dan. 4. 36. But the glory of his Kingdom, his Honour and his Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs returned together with them, his Councellors and his Lords ſought unto him, and he was eſtabliſhed in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and excellent Majeſty was added
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93763:63"/> unto him;</hi> which is a new ſign how unwillingly they diſobeyed him, whom they looked upon as God's vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and that they thought nothing but abſolute neceſſity could excuſe their non-compliance with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but that when that neceſſity was once removed they were ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame obligation as before.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, God's ſuffering him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo long a publick example of inviolate and ſacred Majeſty, his not taking him away, by any untimely death, and perhaps protecting him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the courſe of Nature, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring him after all this to the uſe of his reaſon, and to the full exerciſe of his imperial Dignity and Power, is a plain argument how highly he approved this dutiful behaviour of his Subjects towards him; and a clear proof, eſpecially if you conſider how wicked a King this <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was, that Princes are as to their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Unaccountable, as to their perſons Sacred, and as to their Laws, that they are by no means to be diſputed or diſobeyed by us; unleſs in caſes of a plain and abſolute Neceſſity,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93763:64"/> where we cannot do it, without a manifeſt and open Violence to the laws of God and Nature, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſentiments, or the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of mankind: as it is when ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarchs uſe that abſolute and arbitrary Power, with which they are entruſted only to the utter Ruin, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and Extirpation of their Subjects, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> by his ſanguinary Edicts, and barbarous acts of Soveraignty was uſed to do. In this caſe we are excuſed from obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Commands, but we are in no caſe to reſiſt or fight againſt his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>The force of which argument will extend yet further if you conſider, that though indeed the Eaſtern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are, and have always been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be compoſed of a ſort of people, the fitteſt of all other to bear the Yoke, being by nature the moſt perfect Slaves; being not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, but proud under that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and being ſtrange admirers of the Majeſty and greatneſs of their Princes: yet when this Majeſty was thus eclipſed; when all further obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93763:64"/> was rendered in a manner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, It is an incredible thing that ſuch an awful reſpect for the perſon of their King, when they had ſhaken off all obedience to his Commands, ſhould ſtill remain among all the ſorts, and all the ſeveral degrees, all the ſeveral Conſtitutions and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of men, through all the ſpacious Territories of ſo large an Empire; had it not been that God Almighty did ſome way or other interpoſe in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and did by an immediate hand reſtrain the fury of thoſe, who would otherwiſe have reeked their Revenge upon his perſon, not ſo much out of kindneſs to him, ſo wicked a King, ſo great a Rebel and Traitor to his God, as to put the world in mind of their Duty to the ſupream Powers, who are his Vicegerents and not ours, and therefore accountable to none but him: and that it was God's deſign from the beginning, that his perſon ſhould not be touched, though his power were for the reaſon above mentioned taken away, appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the 15 verſe of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo often cited: <hi>Nevertheleſs leave
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93763:65"/> the ſtump of his roots in the Earth, even with a band of Iron and Braſs,</hi> that is, be ſure that his Perſon, and his Life, which are the Root and Foundation of Power, that theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill ſacred and ſecure, from whence upon his Repentance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, new Glory and Majeſty may ſprout and grow.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt inſtance, in which becauſe I have been much longer than I intended, I ſhall be the more careful to contract my ſelf in thoſe that follow.</p>
            <p>The Second is that of <hi>Ahah,</hi> about which great ſtir has been made by learned men, who will by no means admit that God did actually concur to his deceiving, but without reaſon; for though I will grant that the thing was not exactly, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the <hi>22th.</hi> Chapter of the firſt of <hi>Kings, I ſaw the Lord,</hi> ſays <hi>Micajah, the Son of Imlah,</hi> v. 19. <hi>Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on his Throne, and all the Hoſt of Heaven ſtanding by him, on his right hand, and on his left,</hi> which things notwithſtanding could not be ſeen, God not being a Corporal ſubſtance,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93763:65"/> and the Angels, if they have any Bodies at all, yet they are of that fine and ſubtile Contexture that they could not poſſibly be ſeen by mortal Eyes, neither has God who is ubiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, who is coextended to all places, and to the utmoſt poſſibilty of ſpace, in propriety of ſpeech, any right hand or any left; which modes of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt therefore be referred, not to the reallity of things themſelves, but to the prophetick Scene in which they were repreſented by corporeal Phantaſms to the Imagination of the Prophet, which <hi>Joſephus</hi> underſtood very well, and therefore has omitted a great part of this viſionary appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as not neceſſary to be exactly related: yet to affirm after all this Pompous and magnificent <hi>apparatus,</hi> to ſignifie the approaching fate of the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that God was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe concerned in it, than by his bare permiſſion, ſeems to me ſo far from being true, that it is the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, unlikely thing in the world: we will grant that the Hoſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was not aſſembled around the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence, in that manner which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93763:66"/> is repreſented, and that one of thoſe bleſſed Spirits, for ſuch an one to be ſure is here deſcribed, did not ſtep forth and proffer his ſervice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Ahab;</hi> yet thus much is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, that God did poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to deceive him, and did actually concur towards it, by diſpatching a bleſſed Spirit, as the inſtrument of his wrath, to be a lying or deceiving Spirit, in the mouth of <hi>Ahab's</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
            <p>And if thus much be not the leaſt that is, or can be ſignified by this prophetick Iconiſme in the Hiſtory of <hi>Ahab;</hi> then it muſt be confeſſed that here is a very formal ſtory that ſignifies nothing at all, which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be reaſonable to ſuppoſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be for the honour of God, or of his Prophet, or for the credit of that inſpir'd Book, wherein matters, in which God Almighty is not at all concerned, are ſo pompouſly related, as if it were deſigned to ſhow that he was concerned in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner, and that none but he and his immediate Agents were concerned, I leave to the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93763:66"/> of every ſober and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced perſon.</p>
            <p>To make this a little plainer by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtances of a like nature, the bleſſed Protomartyr St. <hi>Stephen. Acts 7. 55, 56. Being full of the Holy Ghoſt, looked up ſtedfaſtly into Heaven, and ſaw the Glory of God and Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God, and ſaid, behold I ſee the Heavens opened, and the Son of man ſtanding at the right hand of God,</hi> but now if it be true that no man hath ſeen God at any time, and that he hath no ſhape, Colour, or likeneſs by which he can be ſeen, then St. <hi>Stephen</hi> did not ſee him, and conſequently could not ſee the Son of man ſtanding at his right hand; beſides if the Heavens had been really opened, why did not the multitude ſee it as well as he? It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains therefore that it was only a divine impreſſion or ſignature upon the Imagination of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> he was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and had a viſible Idea of thoſe things which were indeed inviſible, but yet all this was not for nothing, it brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it a ſtrong aſſurance of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93763:67"/> truth and goodneſs of God, and of his particular favour to him, and was a kind of ſenſible prelibation of thoſe intellectual Joyes to which he was now going.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Matth. 25. 31, 32, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt at his ſecond coming to judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the world, is repreſented <hi>ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on his Throne with the Holy Angels about him, dividing the Sheep and Goats from one another, and placing the one at his right hand, the other at his left,</hi> and you have there alſo, as if it were an humane Court of Judicature, where every reſpective Priſoner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes a formal proceſs at Law, the Pleas and excuſes of the wicked in Juſtification of themſelves: yet this all the while muſt not be thought to be a true Scheme or Draught of the day of Judgment, but it is only an alluſion to the way of proceeding in criminal cauſes upon Earth. For it is certain that at that day, the beſt of men will be ſufficiently ſenſible of many humane frailties, and of many wilful Sins, <hi>Pſal. 130. v. 3. For if thou Lord ſhouldeſt mark Iniquities, O Lord who ſhall ſtand, but there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93763:67"/> with thee that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> The moſt righteous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man that ſhall appear before that great Tribunal, when he compares his good deeds and his bad ones to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, will put ſo little Confidence in his own merit, as if he had never done any thing at all, <hi>Matth. 25. v. 37, 38, 39. Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungred and fed thee? or thirſty and gave thee drink? When ſaw we thee a Stranger and took thee in? or Naked and Cloathed thee? or when ſaw we thee Sick, or in Priſon, and came unto thee?</hi> 1. Pet. 4. 18. <hi>But if the Righteous ſhall ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and the ſinner appear?</hi> To be ſure there will not need the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Proceſs for the reprobate world, their own Conſciences with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further proof will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Condemn them, and vindicate the divine Juſtice in their Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But yet after all, it would be ridiculous and impious together to make ſuch a magnificent Opera, for the Picture and reſemblance of the laſt Judgment, if there were no ſuch Judgment at all; it is therefore
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93763:68"/> at leaſt ſuppoſed in ſuch a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this, that there ſhall be a ſecond appearance of the bleſſed Jeſus with Majeſty and great Glory to judge the world, and that there will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be a final day of Doom, <hi>Matth. 25. 46. When the wicked ſhall go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into everlaſting Puniſhment, but the Righteous into life Eternal.</hi> And as for the pomp and ſplendor of this judicial Scene, in the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> it is ſuited to the Capacity and to the Imaginations of men; and all the ſhow and formality belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, is borrowed from the Courts of Judicature upon Earth.</p>
            <p>The Application of this, and the preceeding inſtances to the Prophet <hi>Micah's</hi> Viſion in the caſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> is ſo eaſie, and ſo obvious, that I need not inſiſt upon it. But becauſe I have ſaid it was a bleſſed Spirit, which God was pleaſed to diſpatch upon this fatal Errant, which there are many that will not grant, that may be thought to need ſome Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. You muſt conſider therefore that it was one of thoſe Spirits which are exhibited in the Viſion, as ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93763:68"/> round about the Throne of God, but if it be impoſſible that an evil or fallen Spirit, ſuch as are the Devil and his Apoſtate Angels, ſhould ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſo near a Communion with the divine preſence; ſhould bask and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace it ſelf in the comfortable Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, of the divine Glory and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhould enjoy ſo bleſt a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and ſo near a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the immaculate Spirits of thoſe untainted Angels, who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet apoſtatized from their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God: then without granting this to have been ſuch a bleſſed Spirit, that was employed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this deceitful Errant, you muſt be forced to confeſs a very great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decorum in the contexture of this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; which being impreſſed by God himſelf upon the Imagination of the Prophet, it is not likely that it ſhould be ſo very diſagreeable to the Nature, to the Order, and to the poſſibility of things.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed that in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue or Parabolical Narrative of the ſufferings of <hi>Job,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>c. 1. v. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now there was a day when the Sons
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93763:69"/> of God came to preſent themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and Satan came alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them,</hi> and c. 2. v. 1. <hi>Again there was a day, when the Sons of God came to preſent themſelves before the Lord, and Satan came alſo among them, to preſent himſelf before the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Firſt, This in the very truth and downright reality of things can never be, that being the very nature and mainly conſiſtent cauſe of his Miſery, that he is baniſhed from the company of bleſſed Spirits, and from all the favourable influences of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This in the parable it ſelf, is repreſented as a very unuſual and in a manner impoſſible thing, ſuch as God himſelf ſeems, as it were, to wonder and be ſurpriſed at. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he asks him, as if he little look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his appearance there, <hi>Whence comeſt thou? c. 1. v.</hi> 7. and <hi>c. 2. v.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the ſtory of <hi>Ahab</hi> God is repreſented, 1 <hi>Kings 22. 19. Sitting on his Throne, and all the Hoſt of Heaven ſitting by him, on his right hand and on his left.</hi> And it is to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93763:69"/> them that he propounds this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>v. 20. Who ſhall perſwade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?</hi> From whence there are two things to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is introduced as ſpeaking to the Hoſt of Heaven, but by that only the bleſſed Spirits are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: The Devils power and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence being confined to a more fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent and earthy Religion; he is the Prince of the Air, and of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God is made to ſpeak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to them all, therefore they were all alike; but it is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe an Hoſt of wicked Spirits encompaſſing the Throne of God: therefore I conclude, they were all immaculate and good Spirits, that had never yet failed in their obedience to their Maker. So that upon the whole matter it appears, that the form or modification of the parable of <hi>Job,</hi> is ſo far from prejudicing what I have inferred from the conſtruction of that other parable in the ſtory of <hi>Ahab,</hi> that it is indeed a very ſtrong ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and a mighty Confirmation to it.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:93763:70"/>
            <p>But you will ſay a good Spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deceive, why not if God himſelf may do it, as I have proved in ſome caſes that he may, and I affirm this to be one of thoſe caſes? or if you will not believe my bare affirmation, I have ſufficiently proved it.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Sam. 16. 14. It is ſaid the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil Spirit from the Lord troubled him;</hi> it was an evil Spirit, not ſo in it ſelf perhaps, but with relation to <hi>Saul,</hi> whom it was determined to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and vex. An evil Spirit from before the Lord ſay the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſts; by which they ſeem to have had juſt ſuch another Idea of it, as <hi>Micah</hi> had of that Spirit, that was ſent to deceive the Prophets of <hi>Ahab.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you may ſee how widely they are miſtaken, who would needs aſcribe this Phaenomenon of <hi>Ahab</hi> to no more than a divine permiſſion, and not only ſo, but the deception of the Prophets to the immediate agency of wicked Spirits, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and contrary to the decorum and Schematiſm of the place, though
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93763:70"/> otherwiſe, as I know, God does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Devil and his confederate Angels to abuſe and deceive mankind, otherwiſe they could not do it; ſo he may alſo ſometimes be ſuppoſed to employ a wicked Angel to be the Miniſter of his wrath, as well as he may one wicked man to execute his Vengeance upon another, or incite an Idolatrous King to be the ſcourge and chaſtiſement of a backſliding Nation, which yet no man who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands theſe matters will deny but he may do, and that he has ſometimes actually done it.</p>
            <p>Nay, I think the conſtruction of the parable of <hi>Job,</hi> for though it be very true that there was ſuch a man as <hi>Job,</hi> who was a great example of piety in his Proſperous, and of patience in his adverſe Condition; yet the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as it is managed in that ſacred volume that goes by his name, is not the Hiſtory, but the Character of a perfect perſon, and is a parabolical deſcant upon a ground of truth: I ſay the conſtruction or way of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that ſacred ſtory, will, if I am not miſtaken, evince, that God does
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93763:71"/> not only permit, but ſometimes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the degenerate and fallen Angels upon his Errants.</p>
            <p>For Firſt, He ſo expreſſes his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for the time paſt, that he gives him a kind of invitation for the time to come, to make a trial of the virtue and integrity of his ſervant <hi>Job, c. 1. v. 8. Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant Job, that there is none like him in the Earth, a perfect and an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man, one that feareth God, and eſcheweth evil?</hi> and when Satan ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in derogation of his virtue, that it was the effect of his intereſt, and that he ſerved God only for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages occurring to him by it; God gives him an expreſs permiſſion, <hi>v. 12. Behold all that he hath is in thy power, only upon himſelf put not forth thine hand:</hi> and if you conſider all things with that exactneſs which you ought to do, you will find that there was more than a permiſſion in the caſe; It being impoſſible for any finite Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by an act of his will to have ſuch power over the Elements, as Satan is repreſented to have had at that time, and it was a convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93763:71"/> to the Diſciples, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was an extraordinary perſon, and had his miſſion from above, when the Winds and the Sea did hearken to his voice, <hi>Matth. 8. 27. What manner of man is this, that even the Winds and the Sea obey him?</hi> Thus when the deſtroying Angel ſmote the Hoſt of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> with his Rod divided the Red-Sea, and when <hi>Gideon</hi> with his Trumpets blew down the Walls of <hi>Jericho:</hi> We muſt not think that it was the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of that Angel that wrought that execution, the natural ſtrength or skill of <hi>Moſes</hi> or of <hi>Gideon</hi> by which thoſe miraculous effects were brought to paſs, which are ſo plainly above the activity and beyond the ſphere of all humane efficiency and power; but it was the will of God overru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ordinary courſe of Nature, and poſitively concurring to make its laws give place, to the will of theſe Inſtruments commiſſioned and employed by him, neither is this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more than what Satan himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges in the parable of <hi>Job,</hi> where although God is pleaſed to ſay,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93763:72"/> 
               <hi>Behold all that he hath is in thy power, v.</hi> 12. Yet <hi>Satan</hi> plainly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, <hi>v.</hi> 11. That he had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do that miſchief which he did, but what was truely and properly the power of God, <hi>v. 11. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My opinion therefore is, that real miracles, that is, effects far ſurpaſſing the regular ſtrength of Nature, and as much exceeding the power of thoſe at whoſe will thoſe effects are brought to paſs, may be and have been actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally allowed by God to falſe <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and falſe <hi>Chriſts,</hi> as well as to true; to the <hi>Magicians</hi> as well as to <hi>Moſes;</hi> and to the Devil himſelf who is the Prince of darkneſs, as well as to an <hi>Angel</hi> of light; and ſure they were not mere Juggles and impoſtures, which our <hi>Saviour</hi> honours with the Majeſtick titles of great ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſo great that if it were poſſible for ſuch to be deceived, they ſhould deceive the very Elect, and yet this was a power with which the falſe <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and falſe <hi>Prophets</hi> were to be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93763:72"/> indued, by the expreſs prediction of him who was truth it ſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24. Neither is it at all prejudical to ſuch a ſuppoſition as this, that the wonders of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are called <hi>lying wonders, 2 Theſ.</hi> 2. 9, For I do not deny that many have pretended to a power of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles who really had it not, and beſides if you take the whole place together, you will perhaps look upon this place, inſtead of doing any prejudice, to be a confirmation of my opinion, in the <hi>Greek</hi> it is thus, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Whoſe coming or appearance is after the working or activity of <hi>Satan,</hi> with all power and ſigns and wonders of a lie. Now it may ſeem very ſtrange that perfect Tricks and Juggles, the Cheats of Hocus Pocus and Legerdemain ſhould be called not only by the magnificent names of power and ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but of all power, all ſigns, all wonders, for the word <hi>all</hi> is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be referred to each of theſe.</p>
            <p>It will therefore be better to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, wonders of a lie,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93763:73"/> as if the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had ſaid, wonders to confirm a lie, or in confirmation of a falſe Doctrine, as thoſe works may be ſaid to be works of Darkneſs, which are done at Noon-day, becauſe they tend to the confirmation and Eſtabliſhment of the Kingdom of Darkneſs, or to the promotion and encreaſe of <hi>Satan's</hi> uſurped rule and Soveraignty over the minds of men.</p>
            <p>In Miracles there are three things to be conſidered, the nature of them as to their Cauſes, the nature of them as to their Effects, and the tendency of them as to their deſign.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As to their Cauſes, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they ſtould be ſuch as plainly carry along with them, the marks and ſignatures of a ſupernatural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, otherwiſe they are not miracles but Tricks and Juggles.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As to their effects, if they do nothing but Miſchief in the world; or if they are calculated on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for wonder and amazement, not for uſe, theſe are not ſufficient grounds to rely upon; that they are intended by God as a teſtimony to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93763:73"/> the truth: but it is on the contrary juſtly ſuſpicious without ſome further reaſon for our belief, that it is a doctrine of Devils, not of God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the excellence of our <hi>Saviours</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles conſiſted in this, that ſetting aſide his Doctrine, they themſelves were ſo uſeful and beneficial to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he healed Diſeaſes, he cleanſed Lepers, and he caſt out Devils, and he went about continually doing good; which was a very ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that he had no ill deſign to bring any damage or prejudice to the world, (which is the whole ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Diabolical wonders) when all his miracles were ſo full of Love, ſo full of Charity, and Goodneſs to mankind.</p>
            <p>But Thirdly, The tendency of theſe miracles is to be conſidered, we muſt examine carefully thoſe Doctrines which they pretend to advance, if they be inconſiſtent with right reaſon or with natural Religion, they are either Juggles and Impoſtures, or at beſt they are but Diabolical wonders, or it is the power of God cooperating with the wicked Inſinuations of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93763:74"/> Devil, for the Sins of men, to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and to blind the world; but it is impoſſible the Elect ſhould be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they who are truly pious and ſincere, God will not ſuffer them to be ſo fatally impoſed upon, and men of rational and ſober minds will eaſily conclude that theſe miracles are wrought in the name of <hi>Belzebub</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they tend to the promotion of his intereſt, and to the advancement of his Kingdom in the world. Whereas if the Doctrine be conſonant to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and uſeful to mankind, then theſe miracles are divine miracles, then the Doctrine and the miracles do mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally confirm and ſtrengthen one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe by our <hi>Saviours</hi> invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible argument, it would be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd thing for the <hi>Devil</hi> to caſt out himſelf, ſince a Kingdom divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf cannot ſtand.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to have foreſeen that falſe Prophets might be and would be endued with a power of working real miracles and that the <hi>Devil</hi> might and would put on the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of an <hi>Angel</hi> of light, when he ſo ſtraightly charges his <hi>Galathians,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93763:74"/> Gal. 1. 8. If an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed.</hi> Nay, the ſame Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor. 17. 1, 2. That though a man have the gift of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, though he ſpeak with the Tongue of men and Angels, though he underſtand all Myſteries, and all Knowledge, and have all Faith, ſo that he could remove Mountains, yet if he have not Charity he is nothing;</hi> that is, he is nothing in himſelf, and to others he ought to be looked upon only as a <hi>ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling Cymbal,</hi> that is, we are not raſhly to believe him, becauſe without Charity, which is the Companion and intimate Friend of truth, he may deceive us, and it is our <hi>Saviour's</hi> own rule, we muſt judge of Trees by their Fruits, of Doctrines by their Conſonance to natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and by their tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the honour of God and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of men; and of men we muſt judge by the agreeableneſs of their lives and Doctrines to the revealed will of God, and to the voice of reaſon, ſpeaking impartial and uſeful truth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93763:75"/> in the minds of unprejudiced and ſober men.</p>
            <p>The ſum of what I have been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring by this digreſſion, if it be one, to eſtabliſh, is this, That ſince falſe Prophets have wrought true miracles, and ſince thoſe effects which are ſometimes in Scripture aſcribed to the <hi>Devil,</hi> are yet indeed far above the efficiency of any created being, without the concurrence of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, cooperating with, and aſſiſting the will and intention of the evil Spirit, that therefore it is reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to ſuppoſe, as well as very ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to that Hypotheſis which I have laid down, that God does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times endue falſe Prophets with a power of miracles, (and more than that with a perſwaſion that they ſpeak the truth, which was the caſe of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and all the four hundred Prophets, that deceived <hi>Ahab</hi>) the better to blind, harden, and deceive thoſe who have reſiſted the force and evidence of reaſon, or who have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſtinately perſiſted in a wilful neglect of enquiry into truth, or in an open rebellion and defyance to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93763:75"/> the Convictions of it; and that he does ſometimes not only permit, but actually employ the fallen Angels, and degenerate Spirits, to be the Miniſters of his wrath and vengeance, which to conclude this buſineſs, I ſhall confirm by another inſtance. The new Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Samaria</hi> that were tranſplanted thither by <hi>Salmanaſſer</hi> in the room of the ten Tribes, were viſited with Lyons, and multitudes of them were ſlain by them, which is expreſly ſaid to have been a Divine Judgment inflicted upon them for their Idolatry, becauſe they knew not the manner of the God of the Land; but now theſe Lyons ſeem to me not to have been real Lyons, but Devils in their ſhape, both becauſe, I ſuppoſe, it will be hard to find ſo great a number of Lyons in thoſe parts, as might be ſufficient to do ſo great a miſchief, and becauſe common Lyons might have been appeaſed by caſting other Prey in their way, or kept out by Walls and other Fences, or caught by Gins and Snares, or ſhot by Arrows, or poiſoned by ſcattering the Fleſh of Animals tinctured with the rankeſt Poiſon, in their walks; but nothing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93763:76"/> could deſtroy theſe, but the <hi>Samaritans</hi> being inſtructed in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and then they went of themſelves: And it is in alluſion to this, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> compares the Devil to a roaring Lyon, walking about, and ſeeking whom he may devour.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The third Inſtance is that of <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> to whoſe lying with his Father's Concubines in the face of the Sun, I have made God to concur by an expreſs Act of his will. A bold thing you will ſay, and I am glad with all my heart to hear you ſay ſo; it is a very good ſign you are no <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> for they all ſay this, and a great deal more.</p>
            <p>But if God may make a Tyrant, which was <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s caſe, why not an Adulterer too? For when the uſe of Reaſon is taken away, and a Man is given up to his own Luſts and Paſſions, in one Man one Paſſion will prevail, and in another, another, according as the Man's conſtitution is, or as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity preſents its ſelf; beſides, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny is an Uſurpation upon the Rights of all, Adultery only upon thoſe of one; ſo that though Adultery, like
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93763:76"/> other ſorts of Injuſtice, be a very hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous thing, and becauſe of the diſmal Conſequences of it, the worſt ſort of private Injuſtice that can be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the more, becauſe it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt yielding to the importunity of thoſe Deſires which are of the loweſt rank, and belonging to us in common with the Beaſts that periſh; yet Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny (if there be any Degrees of Compariſon in matters of ſo foul a nature) is ſo much worſe than the other, as it is a greater injury to rob a <hi>Caravan,</hi> than to pick a Pocket; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a Nation, than to kill a Man; to ſtop the whole courſe of Law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, than to pronounce an unjuſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon one.</p>
            <p>And though I am far from going about to excuſe ſo nefarious and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable an Action, yet it is ſtill farther to be conſidered, that they were not <hi>Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timae Uxores,</hi> but <hi>Concubinae; David</hi> had them not in Marriage properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but in Concubinage only; and it is very probable they had belonged to <hi>Saul,</hi> his Predeceſſor, before him; for we muſt obſerve, that this fact of <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> was a Judgment upon his Father
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93763:77"/> 
               <hi>David,</hi> for his Adultery with <hi>Bathſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Uriah</hi> the <hi>Hittite;</hi> at which Wickedneſs of his, God was ſo heavily offended, that he ſent him this Meſſage by <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, 2 <hi>Sam. 12. 11, 12. Thus ſaith the Lord, Behold, I will raiſe up Evil againſt thee out of thine own Houſe, and I will take thy Wives before thine Eyes, and give them unto thy Neighbour, and he ſhall lye with thy Wives in the ſight of this Sun: For thou didſt it ſecretly, but I will do this thing before all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and before the Sun;</hi> which Wives are called Concubines, <hi>ch. 16. v.</hi> 22. and were probably the very ſame that were before the Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines of <hi>Saul, c. 12. v.</hi> 8. where God by the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> upbraids <hi>David</hi> with his Bounty towards him; <hi>I gave thee thy Maſter's Houſe, and thy Maſter's Wives into thy Boſom, and gave thee the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and of</hi> Judah. So that though I will not extenuate a Fact, which no good Man can think of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Horrour, yet I would fain know upon ſuppoſition, that God enflam'd the Tyrannical humour of <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> why he might not alſo heighten the luſtful diſpoſition of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> theſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93763:77"/> being but two ſeveral ſorts of Injuſtice, and the latter much leſs criminal than the former? beſides, that this Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, though very heinous, being a breach of Duty to his Father, Loyalty to his King, and Juſtice to Mankind; yet it does not ſeem to have been ſo heinous as that of <hi>Reuben,</hi> who went in unto his Father's Concubine <hi>Bilhah, Gen.</hi> 35. 22. becauſe ſhe by being ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the place of her Miſtreſs, was to all intents and purpoſes in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a lawful Wife, and had herita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Children, which were his half Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren deſcended of her Loyns, and becauſe <hi>Reuben</hi> was under no neceſſity, as <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſeems to have been; for if you conſider that this very event was foretold by <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet; if you reflect upon the ſtrangeneſs of ſo loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and abominable a deed, for of thoſe Concubines there were ten in number; if you conſider the publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it in the face of the Sun, it will ſeem a perfect Miracle, and can be owing to nothing leſs than a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Infatuation on all hands, that ſo grave a Counſellor as old <hi>Achitophel</hi> ſhould give ſuch Advice as this; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:93763:78"/> that <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſhould take it, whether you reflect upon their Relation to his Father, or the unuſual horrour of the Fact it ſelf; or that the Women with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any oppoſition that appears, ſhould ſuffer it; or the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as if there had been no natural Turpitude, nor ſo much as cuſtomary indecency in the thing ſhould flock together with an unanimous Conſent and Approbation to ſo horrid, ſo unclean a ſpectacle, to behold it: For it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Sam. 16. 22. So they ſpread</hi> Abſalom <hi>a Tent upon the top of the Houſe, and</hi> Abſalom <hi>went in unto his Father's Concubines in the ſight of all</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p>It being therefore expreſly prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi'd, that this event ſhould come to paſs by one of <hi>David</hi>'s own Houſe, in the face of the Sun, and in the ſight of all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> which things were yet, if you take them together, (and the laſt of them by its ſelf) morally impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come to paſs, if you will not turn all into an Allegory, which you will find it very hard for you to do, (and if you allegorize <hi>Abſalom,</hi> you muſt do the ſame to <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhebah,</hi> and <hi>Uriah,</hi> to the Menaces of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93763:78"/> 
               <hi>Nathan,</hi> and to the Birth, Reign, and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> becauſe all theſe things have a Connexion with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you muſt allegorize all or none) you muſt be forced to confeſs, that there was more than a Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion requiſite for the fulfilling of this Prophecy, and more there cannot be, without the interpoſition of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power; whence God, as being the cauſe of that neceſſity by which it was done, takes the whole Action upon himſelf, <hi>c. 12. v. 12. For thou didſt it ſecretly,</hi> (ſpeaking of the matter of <hi>Uriah) but I will do this thing before all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and before the Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe things, as they cannot fairly be interpreted any other way than I have done, ſo according to my Hypotheſis they are all very juſt and reaſonable in themſelves, as being only puniſhments to the ſeveral Parties for their reſpective Sins; for <hi>Achitophel, Abſalom,</hi> and the people that followed after him, beſides other Sins, of which we can give no account, had all of them forfeited their Loyalty and Fealty to their lawful King, and joyned together in a wicked and unnatural
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93763:79"/> Confederacy againſt him; and as for the Wives of <hi>David,</hi> if they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to ſo foul a thing, as it does not appear but they were, for want of a better expedient, becauſe we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the perſons at this diſtance of time, we muſt lay the cauſe upon their Adultery, firſt with <hi>Saul,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with <hi>David,</hi> for ſo Polygamy was in the ſtrict acceptation of Law, though Cuſtom ſometimes hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with it, there being no queſtion, but by that Text in <hi>Levit. 18. 18. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou take a Wife to her Siſter to vex her, to uncover her nakedneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the other in her life time:</hi> Polygamy is forbidden, but of this I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more largely in ſome other Papers, which will ſhortly be made publick: but if this will not ſatisfie them, I think it is no unreaſonable preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuppoſe they might be guilty of many other Sins, ſufficient to provoke God to cauſe them to be a ſpectacle of ſo publick ſhame.</p>
            <p>You will ask me, becauſe I generally ſpeak of thoſe who are thus hardened and blinded, as if they were concluded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nder an irreverſible eſtate, whether
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93763:79"/> this be my opinion of all thoſe people, who were the ſpectators of ſuch a ſtrangely abominable, and loathſom Scene: but to this queſtion, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to return any other anſwer, than that nothing certainly can be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but that it is more reaſonable, from the general goodneſs with which moſt of the Inſtances of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are interwoven, to believe that he would not deal ſo ſeverely with ſo vaſt a number together; but that to ſome, if not all, of them he reſtored the uſe of a better Mind, and abated of the ſeverity of his Juſtice with them, as he has been obſerved already to have done in the inſtance of <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this can be no encouragement to any to continue in a courſe of Sin, becauſe ſuch a continuance upon that preſumption is the greater provocation to Almighty God, and makes it more to be feared when he does viſit us, that he will not remove his heavy hand any more. Neither muſt I be thought after all this to make God the Author of Sin, for where neceſſity begins, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality ceaſes, and what ever we do, the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93763:80"/> caſe is the ſame in one Sin as another; after being brought to ſuch a paſs, it is no longer a Sin, but a Judgment upon us for our former Sins. In a word, the reaſons of all Duty are ſome way or other reducible to Intereſt, as I ſhall prove more largely in a Diſcourſe of the Laws of Nature, and their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon in particular why Adultery is a crime, is becauſe it is againſt the common Intereſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; it is apt to breed Quarrels, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, and Blood-ſhed in the World; it lays open the encloſures of Property and Right, by which all humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs are governed and ſupported; it is commonly joyned with a breach of Friendſhip and Truſt, without which there can be no living among Men; it creates an alienation of Affection in Men to their lawful Wives, with whom, becauſe the Laws and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of all Societies have obliged them inſeparably to live, and to run the ſame risk of good and bad Fortune, it is their mutual Intereſt to do nothing that may create a Jealouſie in one another, or make any laſting Feuds or Animoſities
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93763:80"/> between them. Laſtly, it is the direct Road to a proſtitute and wandering Luſt, which is a ſlavery ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a Man, that it ſcarce becomes a Stallion, or a Town Bull, and is always accompanied with the moſt dreadful Miſeries both of Body and Mind.</p>
            <p>And herein conſiſts the goodneſs of God to Men, that he has ordered all things after ſuch a manner, that our Duty and our Intereſt are both the ſame; and beſides that, virtuous Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by the ſad experience of thoſe that are wicked and ſinful, have always been attended with the greateſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity, health, and vigour; he has implanted in our Natures a love and admiration of Goodneſs, he has given us a tender Principle within to be the Guide and Counſellor of our Actions, that naturally feels a ſenſible regret and pain from every thing that is baſe to others, or prejudicial to our ſelves, but enjoys an exquiſite delight and pleaſure in the ſenſe of doing well, and in the memory of it after it is done: but if Men will violently break through all manner of Bounds, and let no conſideration, how powerful ſoever
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93763:81"/> in it ſelf, be ſufficient to prevail with them to leave their Sins, what can be more juſt, ſince they are willfully blind againſt their trueſt Intereſt, and put ſuch an open affront upon him, who has with ſo much goodneſs and tenderneſs ſo carefully provided for it, than that they ſhould be given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to a reprobate mind, to do thoſe things that are unſeemly, and to run on headlong with an impetuous rage and fury upon the mutual deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one another? If we will not ſee our intereſt when it lies ſo plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, we are not certainly to blame Almighty God, if upon ſo great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to him, and ſo many wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affronts and abuſes put upon our ſelves, he ſhall at length remove it perfectly out of our ſight, or make us perſiſt in thoſe courſes, which he may do by virtue of his deſpotical power over us, which tend to our mutual Ruine and Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>It is very fooliſh to make the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs or uncleanneſs of Adultery, that is, its grating upon a modeſt fancy or Imagination, a reaſon why God may not in ſome caſes concur
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93763:81"/> to it, as well as to any other fact, which has the appearance of Sin, but is indeed the effect of an external ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and fate: for the Phyſical cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Adultery, and of a lawful Bed are the ſame, only all the difference is that in one caſe there is a violence done to the undoubted right and property of another; but in the other there is not, in the one the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and government of the world, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all humane affairs have a neceſſary dependance, is diſturbed, but not in the other, and it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but this difference which makes the one criminal, and the other blameleſs; otherwiſe a man of a nice and dainty humour, may apply to himſelf, though never ſo honeſtly deſcended, as well as to one begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in an adulterous coition, the ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtick Epigram of <hi>Palladas.</hi>

To avoid the rage and Tyranny of <hi>Herod,</hi> rather than into any other Country, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, c. 11. v. 1. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>, Out of Egypt have I called my Son,</hi> whoſe going into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and conſequently his calling out of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended only upon Typical reaſons, that he might anſwer the like event of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and that by this he might ſignifie his calling us out of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bondage, of which <hi>Egypt</hi> was a Symbol, into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Aſſertion I prove from thoſe words of St. <hi>John's</hi> Goſpel, <hi>c. 13. v. 27. And after the Sop Satan ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into him,</hi> that is, he was actuated by an evil Spirit of Envy, and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and immediately went forth in a turbulent and outragious humour,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93763:84"/> to ſell his Lord and Maſter to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies the <hi>Jews,</hi> that by <hi>Satan</hi> ſuch a violent ſpirit of anger and revenge is ſignified will not I ſuppoſe, by any be denyed; or if you underſtand it of the perſon of that wicked Angel who is called in Scripture <hi>Satan</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> it comes to the ſame thing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and it will ſeem either way very reaſonable to believe that <hi>Judas</hi> was neceſſitated to what he did.</p>
            <p>Therefore all the queſtion will be by whom this neceſſity was impoſed, that it was immediately from the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> is plain, if you take the words in the latter ſenſe, but yet that hinders not, but he might be commiſſioned or employed by God: But I confeſs I am rather enclinable to interpret it in the former, for <hi>Satan</hi> is from a word that ſignifies enmity and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and ſo may properly enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a malicious and revengeful tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, from whomſoever it proceeds, whether from the naughtineſs of a man's own heart, or by the permiſſion of God from the <hi>Devil,</hi> or by his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Judgment from himſelf.</p>
            <p>However St. <hi>John</hi> tells us expreſly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93763:85"/> that our <hi>Saviour</hi> gave him that Sop, after the eating of which <hi>Satan</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately entered into him; which manifeſtly implies that he was at leaſt more than conſenting to it, not that this Sop is to be looked upon in the nature of an efficient or inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cauſe, any more than ſpittle was a cauſe of reſtoring the blind man to his ſight; but together with the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of this there was a concurrence of the Divine Power, by which the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> that is a Spirit of maſterleſs and ungovernable rage, immediately ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into him, which is very agreeable to the Language of the Scripture, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſonant to my <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> and to reaſon to ſuppoſe, if you conſider how bad a man <hi>Judas</hi> had always been, St. <hi>John's</hi> own Character of him, <hi>is, that he was a Thief, John</hi> 12. 6. And you may add ſafely that he was an <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite</hi> too, otherwiſe he had never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a <hi>Diſciple,</hi> nay, which is more than all this, the <hi>Devil had already put it into his heart to betray his Maſter, John 13. 2. And he had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally covenanted with the chief Prieſts for thirty pieces of Silver, Matth.</hi> 26. 14, 15.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93763:85"/> So that after all this it was no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if he were puniſhed with a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of doing what he had ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly deſigned, but was as yet under ſome kind of heſitancy betwixt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting and yielding to the importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Temptation. Neither is it at all to be wondered (if by <hi>Satan</hi> the Perſon of the great Apoſtate Angel, or of one of his Miſſionaries be to be underſtood) that the ſame effect ſhould ſeem to be aſcribed to God and to the <hi>Devil,</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> who gave the Sop, and to <hi>Satan</hi> who immediately after it entered into him; becauſe in this caſe one may be conſidered as the impulſive cauſe, the other as the immediate Inſtrument, <hi>Satan</hi> neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated <hi>Judas,</hi> by God commiſſioned or employed <hi>Satan,</hi> as it is ſaid in the caſe of <hi>David, 2 Sam. 24. 1. That the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt Iſrael, and he moved David againſt them,</hi> to ſay, <hi>go number Iſrael and Judah,</hi> and yet notwithſtanding, 1 Chron. 21. 1. <hi>Satan ſtood up againſt Iſrael and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked David to number Iſrael,</hi> where by the way it is an unpardonable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius,</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:93763:86"/> who have inſerted the word <hi>Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> into the body of their Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the former place, to make it anſwer the more exactly with the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The words of their Tranſlation are theſe, <hi>Perrexit autem ira Jehovae accendi in Iſraelitas, quum incitaſſet Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarius Davidem in eos, dicendo, age, numera Iſraelem &amp; Jehudam.</hi> I ſay it is an unpardonable preſumption to take ſuch a liberty of Tranſlation as this is, ſince theſe two things are ſo conſiſtent together, as I have ſhown them to be; but it is ſtill more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable in them, according to whoſe principles there is nothing which God cannot do, or may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, his power being the only bounds that can be ſet to his will, and his power being infinite, that is, no bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at all.</p>
            <p>It is further obſervable in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>David,</hi> that he had no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner numbred the people, <hi>But immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately his heart ſmote him: And David ſaid to the Lord, I have ſinned greatly in that I have done. 2 Sam.</hi> 24. 10. that is, when this neceſſity was off, he was ſenſible that he had done amiſs,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93763:86"/> and he ſeemed to himſelf to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a great Sin, as not being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of that neceſſity by which he was compelled to do it, which is every man's caſe who is blinded or harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God; and indeed without a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Fatality, it is impoſſible to ſuppoſe that <hi>David</hi> the man after God's own heart, who was uſed to put ſo great confidence in his God, and ſo little in the number or ſtrength of his Armies, who was uſed to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw multitudes with an handful of men, and had done ſuch incredible wonders, by ſuch deſpicable external means: I ſay, it is impoſſible to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that ſuch an one, ſo long as he had the uſe of his reaſon, and the full exerciſe of the rational faculties of his mind, ſhould ever diſtruſt ſo gracious, or go about to diſoblige ſo good a God, ſo far, as to meaſure his ſtrength by his numbers, as if he doubted the power of the Almighty for the future, or had forgotten what ſignal delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances had been wrought for him, by ſuch inconſiderable and weak Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as in which no humane expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could be placed, and all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93763:87"/> the diſſuaſions of <hi>Joab</hi> and of the Captains of the Hoſt, who all unanimouſly addreſſed themſelves to him to divert him from ſo fatal an intention, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 4. But it is ſaid the King's word prevailed, and notwithſtanding the apparent unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs and ingratitude of the thing, yet there being no expreſs law of God againſt it, the King was of neceſſity to be obey'd: I am afraid there are thoſe in our days, who would think a leſs reaſonable pretence than this ſufficient to excuſe and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their diſobedience.</p>
            <p>What has been ſaid of <hi>Davids</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the people, may be ſaid of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te'r</hi> denying his Maſter, and of <hi>Judas</hi> his betraying him, that at that time when they did it, they were not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of what they did, but were hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by an irreſiſtible force which it was utterly impoſſible for them to withſtand, but afterwards when that <hi>impetus</hi> was abated, and they came perfectly to themſelves, they both of them relented, and being altogether inſenſible of that divine Judgment by which they were violently compelled
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93763:87"/> to what they did, they imputed the whole action entirely to themſelves; wherefore the one <hi>wept bitterly,</hi> and the other <hi>went out and hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the inſtance of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the circumſtances with which that ſtory is related in St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel will ſufficiently evince what I have affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be true, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. from the thirty firſt, to the thirty ſixth verſe we have theſe words, <hi>Then ſaith Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus unto them,</hi> (the Diſciples) <hi>all ye ſhall be offended becauſe of me this Night. For it is written I will ſmite the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and the Sheep of the Flock ſhall be ſcattered abroad—Peter anſwered and ſaid unto him though all men ſhall be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded becauſe of thee, yet will I never be offended. Jeſus ſaid unto him, Verily, I ſay unto thee, that this Night, before the Cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice, Peter ſaid unto him, though I ſhould die with thee, yet will I not deny thee:</hi> here we may ſee how firm and zealous a reſolution <hi>Peter</hi> had made, and we have all the reaſon in the world to believe he was in very good earneſt: <hi>Likewiſe alſo ſaid all the Diſciples, v.</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:93763:88"/> 35. But none as it ſeems, with ſo much heat and aſſeveration as he, yet they all forſook him when the Trial came, and <hi>Peter</hi> denied with the moſt horrid Oaths and Execrations that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he knew ſuch a man, and all this the very ſame Night in which they entered into ſo ſolemn an engagement to adhere and ſtick to their Maſter to the laſt.</p>
            <p>It will be worth our while to ſet down all the Circumſtances of this Tranſaction as they are related by St. <hi>Matthew, c. 26. v. 37. He took with him Peter, and the two Sons of Zebedee, and began to be ſorrowful and very heavy.</hi> The two Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> were <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the Diſciple whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> loved, and his taking theſe three a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder from the reſt of the Diſciples at that time, was an argument of a particular favour and eſteem for them above the reſt; and being done, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after they had all obliged themſelves in ſo ſolemn a manner to ſtick by him, it is an infallible Sign, that he thought their intentions real, and that their love to him was every whit as paſſionate and cordial in it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93763:88"/> ſelf, as it ſeemed to outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for there can be nothing more unacceptable to the ſearcher of Hearts, than a diſſembled Profeſſion of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and obedience to him: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we find one of them ſo mindful of his promiſe, and inſpired with ſo affectionate a Zeal for the ſafety and defence of his Maſter, <hi>v.</hi> 47. that <hi>when</hi> Judas, <hi>one of the Twelve, came with a great Multitude with Swords and Staves from the chief Prieſts and Elders of the people to apprehend him, behold, one of the Diſciples which were with</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſtretched out his hand and drew his Sword, and ſtroke a Servant of the high Prieſts, and ſmote off his Ear;</hi> and who ſhould this Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be but <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, who ſeems to have done this in purſuance of that Reſolution which he had ſo lately made? <hi>John 18. 10. Then</hi> Simon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>having a Sword drew it, and ſmote the high Prieſt's Servant, and cut off his right Ear; the Servant's name was</hi> Malchus: Neither was this all, but when <hi>all the Diſciples forſook him and fled,</hi> Mat. 26. 8. yet <hi>Peter</hi> ſtill <hi>followed him afar off unto the high Prieſt's Palace, and went in, and ſate with the Servants to ſee the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:93763:89"/>
            <p>Thus far therefore his Reſolution continued vigorous and warm, and he was ſtill mindful of his promiſe, not to forſake or to deny his Maſter: But now all of a ſudden, as if he had never dreamt of any ſuch promiſe, or thought of any ſuch reſolution, though he had but newly made it, it came to paſs, <hi>v. 69. ad 74. That as Peter ſate without in the Palace, a Damſel came to him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou alſo waſt with Jeſus of</hi> Galilee; <hi>but he denied before them all, ſaying, I know not what thou ſayeſt: And when he was gone out into the Porch, another Maid ſaw him, and ſaid unto them that were there, This fellow was alſo with Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth; <hi>and he again denied with an Oath, I do not know the Man: And after a while came unto him they that ſtood by, and ſaid to</hi> Peter, <hi>Surely thou alſo art one of them, for thy ſpeech bewrayeth thee; then began he to curſe and to ſwear, ſaying, I know not the Man.</hi> A wonderful alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for ſo ſmall a time. What? Shall we think that he had the courage but juſt now to wound the high Prieſt's own Servant in the midſt of ſo great a number of armed Men, as might be ſufficient to juſtifie and excuſe his fear,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93763:89"/> or rather prudence, if he had not done it, ſhould now be ſo wretchedly poſſeſt with fear, as not to dare to own his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to one of the weaker Sex; but on the contrary, rather than confeſs him, ſhould with ſuch horrid Oaths and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations impiouſly perjure and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear himſelf? Or is it not more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he had indeed forgot his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to that degree, that he knew not the Man, and had loſt all memory of his having been once his Diſciple? This is both more pious to believe, and more agreeable to what follows, <hi>v. 74, 75. And immediately the Cock crew, and</hi> Peter <hi>remembred the words of Jeſus, which ſaid unto him, Before the Cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice; and he went out, and wept bitterly.</hi> But if he did not remember this 'till then, 'tis manifeſt he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got it before, and conſequently had forgot alſo that vow and reſolution, of which thoſe words of Chriſt were the occaſion; and if you grant thus much, it will be no hard matter to conceive, that he might ſpeak truth alſo when he ſaid, <hi>I know not what thou ſayeſt,</hi> and <hi>I know not the Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:93763:90"/>
            <p>But when the Cock crew, then God was pleaſed to reſtore him the uſe of his Memory, and the exerciſe of his rational and diſcourſive Faculties; he began to perceive then what he was doing, and found himſelf denying his Maſter, wherefore his Heart ſmote him, as <hi>David</hi>'s did, when he had num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the people, <hi>And he went out, and wept bitterly,</hi> which is another very ſtrange and ſudden alteration, from the cutting of <hi>Malchus</hi> his Ear, to ſuch an obſtinate denial of his Lord; and from ſuch an obſtinate and ſtiff denial, to ſuch a degree of ſorrow and remorſe: All which things, as they cannot with any ſhew of reaſon be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the natural turns of a Man's own Mind, or the ordinary reſult of humane Paſſions left perfectly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that a Man ſhould be ſo conſtant, and ſo falſe, and ſo penitent, all in a breath; ſo I think it is ſufficiently clear from <hi>v.</hi> 75. that <hi>Peter</hi> in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial had loſt all ſenſe and memory of him whom he denied, and that this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of his was the effect of a Divine Judgment.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:93763:90"/>
            <p>If you ask me, for what reaſon ſuch a Judgment ſhould be inflicted? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, It was a puniſhment to him, and to the reſt, for their preſumption; they leaned too much upon their own ſtrength, and thought themſelves ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of themſelves to withſtand any danger, and to reſiſt any temptation how great ſoever, not conſidering that humane Frailty is ſo far from being able to maintain ſo great a Combat by its own ſtrength, that ſetting aſide the aſſiſtances of Grace, without which no ſuch Conflict can be ſucceſsfully mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the very ordinary powers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are at God's diſpoſal, and he may either permit or obſtruct the uſe of them as he pleaſes himſelf; all our Springs are in, and all our Faculties are from him.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable therefore, that as the deſertion of ten of them; (for <hi>Judas</hi> is not now to be reckoned) and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of <hi>Peter</hi> was an effect of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: <hi>Though I ſhould dye with thee,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Peter) yet will I not deny thee;</hi> likewiſe alſo ſaid all the Diſciples: Yet <hi>Peter</hi> was more poſitive, more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous than the reſt, and therefore
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93763:91"/> he is made the greater example of the Infirmity of humane Nature; the reſt only forſook their Lord, but <hi>Peter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, which was much more; for it is in ſome caſes lawful to fly from Perſecution, but in none to make an expreſs renunciation of Chriſt, or of his Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter I make no ſcruple to affirm, That the denial of <hi>Peter</hi> three ſeveral times, the Maidens and others giving him ſo many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by their Interrogatories to do it, and the Cock's crowing juſt at the third time, were all of them managed by a Divine fate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judas</hi> his caſe agrees in this with that of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> that he was hurried on to what he did by a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity not to be reſiſted; for it is ſaid, That <hi>Satan</hi> entred into him as he did into <hi>David;</hi> but yet as in the inſtance of <hi>David,</hi> it was no leſs true, that the Lord moved him to number the people, by which it muſt be meant, either that the Lord imployed Satan as his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to harden the Heart, and blind the Eyes of <hi>David,</hi> or that there was a concurrence of the Divine and Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93763:91"/> Power together in order to this end: So alſo in the buſineſs of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> it is ſaid, That Satan entred into him; but that was not 'till Chriſt had given him the Sop, which ſeems to have been, as it were, the ſignal for Satan to begin to play his part; and it is added from our Saviour's own mouth immediately after, ſpeaking to <hi>Judas</hi> as he was going out, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93763:92"/> harboured ſuch a wicked intention in his Heart; that he had not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, but that he had actually cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted and agreed with the chief Prieſts about it; which is but another inſtance, added to thoſe of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> of the concurrence of the free and the neceſſary principle together.</p>
            <p>But now whereas I have affirmed that one <hi>Judas,</hi> and that this very <hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> was beforehand deſigned and pitched upon by Divine providence to betray his Maſter, I will now add, that he was the rather pitched upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was of the Family of the <hi>Iſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Lepers,</hi> becauſe the Leproſie was an argument of guilt under the Law: The Jewiſh Maſters tell us, it was the puniſhment of Pride; and therefore the ſcarlet Wool, Cedar Wood, and Hyſſop, which were the Materials made uſe of in the luſtration of it, were to denote partly the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of Sin in general, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expiated but by Blood, which was the meaning of the ſcarlet Wool, and the reaſon of thoſe Sacrifices which were enjoyned in this caſe by
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93763:92"/> way of expiation; partly that Pride or haughtineſs of Mind, of which the Cedar Tree, by reaſon of its uſual height, was a very fit and proper Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem, which was the cauſe or occaſion why this Diſeaſe was inflicted; and partly that Humility, that pious Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and equability of Spirit, to which the diſeaſed party was warned by this way of expiation to return, the Hyſſop being to a very Proverb the moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deſpicable of all kind of Plants whatſoever, 1 <hi>King. 4. 33.

               </gap> Not that this depended upon any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt reading of any place in the New Teſtament as <hi>Druſius</hi> imagines, but it happened, as I conceive, thus: <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact</hi> had read in ſome other Hiſtory of thoſe Times not now extant, or in ſome other Author who had borrowed it from thence, of one <hi>Simon Iſcariot,</hi> for that was his proper Name, being the ſame with <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap>, the <hi>Leper;</hi> and then thinking with himſelf that <hi>Judas</hi> was always called in Scripture <hi>Iſcariot,</hi>

               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are certainly the ſame, that it was the common name of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, not proper to his Perſon, and that <hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> was the Son of <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper. Which conjecture, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demonſtration; when I conſider how natural and eaſie it is in its ſelf, how uſeful for explaining the Hiſtory, and by conſequence for vindicating the Authority of the Scripture: and when I compare it with the frigid and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetcht conceits of <hi>Zacharias Chryſopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus, Theodore Beza, Camero, Druſius, Caninius, Grotius,</hi> Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> and others, I can hardly forbear paying my acknowledgments to the Divine Goodneſs for ſo uſeful a Diſcovery in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93763:95"/> the ſame Language, in which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did it in behalf of his Diſciples, a few contemptible Fiſhermen, and Handicraft Mechanicks, to whom God by him had revealed thoſe Myſteries which were unknown to the Sages and Rabbins of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 25, 26. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p>Thus much may ſuffice to have been ſpoken concerning thoſe particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which are moſt obnoxious to exception in the following Diſcourſe; but it is certain, that what God may juſtly do to one Man, that he may alſo do to a whole Nation, which is but an aggregate of ſo many ſingle Men, if the cauſe for which a puniſhment is inflicted be as Epidemical as the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment it ſelf.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder therefore, when there were few or none of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> but what were more or leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in oppreſſing the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and impoſing thoſe intolerable Burthens upon them; it is no wonder, I ſay, if
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93763:96"/> a divine or fatal Obduration were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded to that which was ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and owing to themſelves, and if the one were alike Epidemical with the other, for the caſe being exactly the ſame with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and with his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or Servants, for <hi>when Pharaoh ſaw that the Rain, and the Hail, and the Thunders were ceaſed, he ſinned yet more, and hardened his Heart, he, and his Servants; Gen.</hi> 9. 34. The way of dealing or proceeding with them, muſt likewiſe in all reaſon and juſtice be the ſame.</p>
            <p>And what hath been ſaid of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is true in its proportion of the <hi>Jews</hi> in that of our Saviour, and in all the ſucceeding Ages down to this very day; they are the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 11. 25. <hi>I would not, Brethren, that ye ſhould be ignorant of this Myſtery (leſt you ſhould be wiſe in your own conceits) that blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in part is happened to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>until the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in:</hi> But yet we muſt not think that this was the only reaſon, and that God, out of no conſideration but only his own Arbitrary choice, did prefer the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93763:96"/> before the Jews; or that he was carried forth by ſomething in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into a greater love for one than for the other, for he is no reſpecter of perſons; and beſides, at this rate the <hi>Gentiles</hi> would have had ſome reaſon, if not to be wiſe, yet to be pufft up and exalted in their own conceits; but it depended originally upon the wilful and voluntary Tranſgreſſions of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, on whom God had in vain beſtowed the moſt particular and ſignal Marks of his favour. <hi>Rom. 9. 4, 5. Who were the Iſraelites to whom pertained the Adoption, and the Glory, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and the giving of the Law, and the Service of God, and the Promiſes; whoſe were the Fathers, and of whom, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Fleſh, Chriſt came:</hi> And when he did come, he ſpent the time of his Sojourning upon Earth among his Countrymen the <hi>Jews,</hi> it was among them he preached, among them he wrought his Miracles, among them he ſpake by their own confeſſion as never Man ſpake, and did thoſe Wonders which it was impoſſible for a meer Man to do; and what he did himſelf, that he recommended alſo in his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93763:97"/> to the practice of the Diſciples when he ſent them abroad, <hi>Matth. 10. 5, 6. Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any City of the Samaritans enter ye not; but go rather to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſrael:</hi> He did not forbid them wholly to preach to the Gentiles, but they were to begin with the Jews, <hi>Go rather to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſrael;</hi> which Inſtructions were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards exactly obſerved by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who did not exerciſe their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip among the Gentiles, 'till ſuch time as they had firſt been rejected of the Jews, <hi>Acts 13. 45, 46, 47. But when the Jews, filled with envy, ſpake againſt thoſe things which were ſpoken by Paul, contradicting and blaſpheming; then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and ſaid, It was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken to you; but ſeeing ye put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life: Lo, we turn to the Gentiles, for ſo hath the Lord commanded us, ſaying I have ſet thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou ſhouldeſt be for Salvation unto the ends of the Earth. Eſa.</hi> 49. 6. So true is it, that ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means had been uſed to render
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93763:97"/> the <hi>Jews</hi> inexcuſable before they were rejected. They did not ſtumble that they might fall, but they firſt fell of themſelves, and then they were blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and hardened by God. <hi>Have they ſtumbled that they ſhould fall?</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>God forbid, but rather through their fall Salvation is come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gentiles; for to provoke them to Jealouſie,</hi> that is, to awaken them out of this benummed Eſtate, <hi>and be a happy means of their riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> for many ages before were in expectation of <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come, and it appears by ſeveral paſſages up and down in the Goſpels, that he was expected at that very time when our <hi>Saviour</hi> appeared upon Earth: But there were three or four ſeveral things which hindered them from believing him to be the perſon.</p>
            <p>As Firſt, That they expected a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Prince, that ſhould deliver them from the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, and ſhould eſtabliſh them in a laſting Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and dominion over the Nations round about them; which appears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things from <hi>Herod's</hi> cruel
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93763:98"/> Edict <hi>for the ſlaying the Male-Children in Bethlehem and in all the Coaſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from two years old and under, with a deſign among them to have ſlain the King of the Jews, Matth.</hi> 2. 16. that is, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was to come, which proves plainly what notion the <hi>Jews</hi> had at that time of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> beſides that it would have been a ridiculous piece of Cruelty, for <hi>Herod</hi> to have done what he did upon any other ſuppoſition, than that the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was a Kingdom of this world, that ſo by ſlaying of him he might ſecure the Soveraignty to himſelf and his Poſterity for ever, which was no queſtion his deſign.</p>
            <p>When therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> found themſelves ſo much diſappointed, in a mean, mechanick and obſcure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Carpenter laying claim to ſo Auguſt a Title as that of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding making no pretences to a temporal Kingdom, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mightily diſowning and diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and inſtead thereof preaching obedience to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and thoſe that were commiſſioned and employed by
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93763:98"/> him, this was a mighty prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, that he could not be the perſon deſigned; when the notion which they had conceived of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> was ſo contrary in all reſpects to what he expreſly declared of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo inconſiſtent with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious uſage, which he not only ſuffered himſelf, but told all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers they muſt expect no better.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Prejudice was taken from his Parentage, they expected a <hi>Meſſias</hi> of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> but <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> the Carpenter, whoſe reputed Son our <hi>Saviour</hi> was, though he were of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> yet he was either not known to be of the Lineage of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> or it was not thought likely that ſo mean a Sprout of the <hi>Davi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical</hi> Stock, ſhould beſtow the ſo much talked of, and the ſo long expected <hi>Meſſias</hi> upon their Nation: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let him preach never ſo much to their Aſtoniſhment and Admiration, let him do never ſo many Miracles, and work never ſo great wonders; yet ſtill they would be ſaying, <hi>Matth. 13. 55, Is not this the Carpenters Son?</hi> And <hi>Mark 6. 3, Is not this the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93763:99"/> the Son of Mary?</hi> As if it were impoſſible he ſhould be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the great <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> that was to come among them, who was ſo poorly deſcended, and was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo very mean a perſon.</p>
            <p>The third Prejudice was, that they thought him to have been born not in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi> but in <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> of <hi>Galilee.</hi> Whereas it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to a Proverb among them, that out of <hi>Galilee</hi> no good could come, and that out of <hi>Nazareth</hi> no Prophet could ariſe: For ſo great was the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh</hi> Planters of <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Galilee,</hi> that they could never believe God Almighty would ſend them a <hi>Meſſias</hi> from thence; or that the moſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and avowed Enemies of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Nation, ſhould ever have that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vouchſafed to them from above; as that the greateſt King, the moſt infallible Prophet, and every way the moſt illuſtrious and accompliſht Perſon that the <hi>Jews</hi> had ever ſeen, or were ever to expect, ſhould be born among <hi>Hereticks, Idolaters,</hi> and ſuch as were worſe than <hi>Pagans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:93763:99"/> which was the beſt language a <hi>Jew</hi> would be brought to allow to any <hi>Samaritan</hi> or <hi>Galilean;</hi> and though it is true there were Multitudes of <hi>Jews</hi> interſperſed about in <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> yet, as if they had all been blaſted from the Cradle by a ſort of <hi>Heretical</hi> Contagion from the ſoyl of ſo accurſed a place, they would not allow that the Spirit of God, or of Prophecy could reſt upon them.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt great Prejudice which I ſhall mention, was taken from his laying ſo little ſtreſs upon the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial part of the Moſaical Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and his ſo frequent, and ſo bitter invectives againſt the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> matters, whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority among the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees of thoſe times, and conſequently among the much greateſt part of the people, was accounted ſo Sacred, that it was held equal, if not Superior, to the written Law.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the main Prejudices, which the <hi>Jews</hi> in our <hi>Saviour's</hi> time laboured under, theſe were the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why they did not receive him as the Prophet that was to come, the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93763:100"/> 
               <hi>Meſſias</hi> and the King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and as theſe Prejudices were all of them very great in themſelves, very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful obſtructions againſt the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of his Perſon, or his Goſpel; ſo they were ſtill further enflamed by the perpetual inculcation of his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemies the Scribes and Phariſees, and Lawyers of thoſe times, who would have loſt all Credit and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority among the people, if either his perſon had received that entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was due to the ſacred Character of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> or if his Doctrine which was ſo great an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Diſſimulation and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, the Covetouſneſs and Extortion, the Pride, Affectation, and ſupercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous behaviour of thoſe <hi>whited Walls,</hi> and <hi>painted Sepulchres,</hi> had ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed or got to be in vogue among them.</p>
            <p>But yet notwithſtanding ſo great were his Miracles, and ſo uſeful to the world, ſo holy was his Life, and ſo excellent his Doctrine, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Confeſſions from his greateſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, very much to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their Cauſe; and if they would

               </gap>ittle value upon the ritual part of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, when he came to introduce that purity of Mind and will, of which thoſe <hi>Moſaical</hi> waſhings and Luſtrations were but a faint ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and Typical Repreſentation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Though it was true they did expect then generally not a ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but a Triumphant and Victo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious <hi>Meſſias,</hi> one whoſe head ſhould be encircled, not with a Crown of Thorns, but with a Chaplet of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels: yet this was an opinion wholly owing to that exquiſite hatred which they had conceived againſt their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, of whom they hoped to be ſufficiently revenged in the Reign of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and to the pride and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93763:101"/> of that humour which then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed among them.</p>
            <p>But if they had conſidered coolly and impartially with themſelves, it would have appeared very reaſonable to believe that all the Sacrifices and expiations of the Law were but Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical of that one great Sacrifice, which was in the fulneſs of time to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up for the Sins of the whole world, and after which there was to be no more Sacrifice for Sin: beſides that it was propheſied of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Daniel, Dan. 9. 27. That he ſhould cauſe the Sacrifice and oblation to ceaſe.</hi> They might have learnt from the writings of the ſame Prophet, <hi>ib v. 26. That the Meſſias after a certain period of time was to be cut off, but not for himſelf, but for the Sins of others:</hi> And that after this the Deſtruction of the ſecond Temple, and of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and of the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy was very ſoon to follow. They might have known from the Characters which other Prophets have given, but more eſpecially from thoſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that it was a Suffering not a Reigning <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93763:101"/> was to come among them, and ſave them not from their Enemies, but their Sins.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Their own traditions would have told them, if they had harkened to them, what manner of <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was, who was to be expected, for they all agreed he was to come ſome time or other upon the Anniverſary of the Feaſt of the Paſſover; and it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obſervation among the <hi>Jews</hi> to this Day, that all their great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances have hapned upon this Day; they acknowledge therefore that the deliverance of the Firſt-Born of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the blood of the Paſchal Lamb, when the firſt born of <hi>Egypt</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and the paſſage, or Paſſover through the Red-Sea, that is, through a Sea of blood, was Typical of that great deliverance which was in the fulneſs of time to be purchaſed for them by the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> but now nothing is more plain, than that the Sacrifice of the Paſſover, and the Paſſage through the Red-Sea, which was a ſhadow of deliverance by blood, might be very proper Types of a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but by no means of a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93763:102"/> Triumphant. For what expiation is there in Conqueſt? How does Confidence and Aſſurance anſwer to Fear? Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Triumph to a dangerous and uncertain paſſage through the middeſt of an impending Sea, and thorough the dry places of a barren Wilderneſs into the land of <hi>Canaan?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſo far therefore from being true, that ſuch a temporal Prince as they looked for, was really to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; that on the contrary all things were ſo very plain againſt them the other way, that it can hardly ſeem leſs than a divine Infatuation, for the Sins of that and former Ages, that the <hi>Jews</hi> in our <hi>Saviours</hi> time were ſo generally and ſo obſtinately of this opinion, eſpecially if you conſider, that it was neceſſary in order to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſigns of Providence to paſs, that they ſhould be of this mind; For certainly had they believed him to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was no otherwiſe to deliver them than by ſuffering for them; they, of all men in the world, would not have embrued their hands in his blood, which yet it was Typically neceſſary
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93763:102"/> they ſhould do, becauſe the Lamb of the Paſſover was to be ſlain by the whole Congregation.</p>
            <p>But ſtill the fatality was not yet ſo ſtrong, but in many of them at leaſt, it might have been overcome, had they not provoked God to inflict a further degree of Obduration by new Provocations, by the contumelious uſage of his Perſon, and by aſcribing his Miracles to the efficiency of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Spirits, notwithſtanding they carried in themſelves ſo plain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of a divine power, and were intended to promote a Doctrine ſo uſeful and advantageous to mankind, for which our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells them, that is to ſay, thoſe of them who were the moſt eminently and obſtinately guilty of it; that they ſhould not be <hi>forgiven either in this World, or the next:</hi> what more plain therefore than that their hearts from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward were hardened? That the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was paſt againſt them by the juſt Judgment and decree of Heaven? and that they were given over paſt all recovery to a final impenitence and irreverſible doom?</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:93763:103"/>
            <p>Neither in truth is it poſſible to conceive that any thing leſs than this could be the occaſion of that execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deriſion of our Lord upon the Croſs, when in the pangs of the moſt bitter Agony, that humane Nature was capable of enduring, he cryed out with a loud and mournful voice, <hi>Eli Eli Lammahſabacthani, my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> At which ſome of them in deriſion ſaid he calleth for <hi>Elias:</hi> which knowing profanation of the name of God, and from the mouth of <hi>Jews,</hi> with whom it has always been ſuperſtitiouſly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, cannot eaſily be attributed to any thing leſs than a ſupernatural ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration.</p>
            <p>Nay, when the Sun it ſelf aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at ſo dire a ſpectacle, durſt not behold it, but darkneſs overſpread the face of the whole Earth from the ſixth to the ninth hour; and when at his giving up the Ghoſt the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth were ſhaken, and the relenting Rocks were cleft in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; when the Graves were opened, and the Dead by the groans of Nature were awakened; when the whole
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93763:103"/> frame and order of the Univerſe was inverted; when the vail of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was rent in twain; when the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion and the Guards amazed, ſmote every Man his hand upon his Breaſt, and ſaid, <hi>Truly, this was the Son of God;</hi> yet the Jews nothing concerned all this while, were ſo far from being moved by ſo many, and ſo great Teſtimonies given to the Divinity of his Doctrine and his Perſon, that againſt the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt convictions of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, they perſiſted ſtill in an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and open defiance to them both: nay, after his Crucifixion and his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, when to prevent the pretence of his riſing on the third day, a ſtrong Guard was ſet upon the Tomb, and yet after all this he did notwithſtanding ariſe, not by any trick or juggle, which that Watch was purpoſely placed to obſtruct, but in reality and truth, to the wonder and aſtoniſhment of all Men, and of the Chief Prieſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themſelves; yet all this would not melt them into any degree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but they were ſtill ſo far from yielding to ſo plain Convictions, that by the unanimous conſent of a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93763:104"/> numerous Aſſembly it was agreed, That the Soldiers muſt be bribed to confeſs themſelves not only negligent in their Duty, but that they were all faſt aſleep at one and the ſame time, which was a very ſtrange thing, and ſo faſt aſleep, that all the noiſe and buſtle of the removal of a maſſy Stone (on which it is very like ſome of the Guard themſelves might ſit, as the Angel did afterwards when it was rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away) would not awake one of them into the leaſt ſenſe or knowledge of what was done. And yet if what they ſaid was really true, if they were all never ſo faſt aſleep, all that could be made of that would be, that they could not tell whether his Diſciples had ſtollen him or no, or whether he was really riſen from the Dead: So that by this pretence there was no proof either way; and it being very improbable, that ſo many Men ſet purpoſely to watch, ſhould be ſo forgetful of their Duty, ſhould do ſo notorious a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to Military Diſcipline, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a fault which is uſed to be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed by the neceſſary rigour of Military Juſtice, it is plain, that as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93763:104"/> what they ſaid was no evidence either way upon ſuppoſition that it was true, ſo it was ſo prodigiouſly unlikely and improbable a ſtory, that ſcarce any Man in his wits would ever believe it to be ſo; but yet this ridiculous Tale was partly ſwallowed by the <hi>Jews</hi> for truth, and partly embraced and abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thoſe that made it, and thoſe that knew it certainly to be a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and wicked lye: And now if you ask the reaſon of ſo great credulity on the one hand, or ſo great impiety and impudence on the other, it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to aſcribe it with any ſhew of probability to any thing leſs than a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine infatuation, according to that known ſaying,</p>
            <q>Quos perdere vult Jupiter dementat prius.</q>
            <p>But yet, after all this, they were not perfectly given over, but the Apoſtles (as I have ſaid, according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Inſtructions) did begin the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Miniſtry with the <hi>Jews,</hi> by whom when they had been ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and contumeliouſly rejected, they then applied themſelves to the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93763:105"/> of the Gentile world; and though no doubt it was then the caſe of very many of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened into a final Impenitence, yet there were alſo very many who were not in ſo deplorable a condition, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would be ridiculous for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as he does, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3. to <hi>wiſh himſelf accurſed from Chriſt;</hi> (though you muſt not take that to be ſpoken in the utmoſt rigour of propriety, but he does by this expreſſion ſignifie a very paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Zeal for the Salvation of <hi>his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Kinſmen according to the Fleſh</hi>) for what can be more abſurd than ſuch a deſire, if he knew there was an irreverſible Decree gone out againſt them for their final Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and obduration? Or what more impious, than to ſet himſelf and his will in oppoſition to the Divine Will and Decree, by which the <hi>Jews</hi> were irrecoverably given over to a reprobate ſenſe, and placed beyond all poſſibility of Salvation? One would think he might at leaſt have added what his Maſter did before, when he was to drink that bitter Cup ſo diſagreeable and diſtaſtful to humane Nature, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs

            </p>
            <p>The ſame may be argued from <hi>c. 10. v. 1. My hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaved;</hi> and from <hi>c. 11. v. 14.

            <p>Firſt, That this calamity (for that is another ſenſe of this word taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by the ancient Lexicographers, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>Secondly, It may be ſaid to have been in part, in that all the <hi>Jews</hi> were not hardened or blinded; but on ſome the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and the Light of the Goſpel, ſhone as brightly as on the <hi>Gentile</hi> World.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Of thoſe that were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and blinded, all were not in an irreverſible condition, but ſome had ſtill ſome power and liberty left them of returning to a better mind, or at
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93763:107"/> leaſt that God had reſolved to deal ſo mercifully and kindly with them, as to take off that ſupernatural blindneſs from their Eyes, and hardneſs from their Hearts, that they might ſee and feel the truth, and arrive at a due ſenſe and knowledge of themſelves and him, which ſeems to be the meaning of that paſſage in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, c. 10. v.</hi> 21, 22. applied by St. <hi>Paul, Rom. 9. 27. The Remnant ſhall return, even the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Jacob unto the mighty God; for though thy people Iſrael be as the ſand of the Sea, yet a Remnant of them ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:</hi> And it was for theſe, not thoſe who were concluded under a final and irrecoverable Doom, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Prayers and endeavours were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for theſe and none but theſe, <hi>that to the Jews, he became as a Jew, that he might gain the Jews: And to them that were under the Law, as under the Law; that he might gain them that were under the Law, 1 Cor. c. 9. v.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>And now from this Account which I have given of Gods dealing with the people of the <hi>Jews;</hi> I ſhall make theſe following obſervations.</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:93763:107"/>
            <p>Firſt, That the deſign of theſe three Chapters, the <hi>9th. 10th.</hi> and <hi>11th.</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> is only to give an account of the rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the reaſons upon which it depended.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That one reaſon of their rejection was owing to themſelves, for having abuſed the Patience and the Mercy of God, and ſlighted the means and opportunities of Salvation; which is ſo far from giving any Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or favour to the Doctrine of irreſpective Reprobation, that it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly deſtroys it: In as much as here is, here all along a plain conſiſtence obſerved to the ordinary notions of Equity and Juſtice amongſt men; nay, theſe three Chapters of St. <hi>Paul</hi> are ſo far from giving any advantage to that cauſe, that after all theſe provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations which might make it very juſt, <hi>à parte Poſt</hi> to Doom ſo many obſtinate Sinners to eternal Torments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though the <hi>Jews</hi> were under ſo great diſadvantages at that time, by the ſubſtraction of the divine Grace, and by a poſitive Judgment of Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obduration ſuperadded to it; that it may ſeem morally impoſſible
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93763:108"/> for many of them to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, and to an hearty Repentance for their Sins, that ſo they might be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Though it be very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe that God did, as in Juſtice he might, actually put ſome of them into ſuch a Condition that there was a natural impoſſibility of their Repentance; yet it cannot be proved from any thing in all that long diſcourſe of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that any one <hi>Jew</hi> was ſo wholly blinded, hardened, and utterly forſaken by the Grace of God, and by the natural powers of his own mind and will; that it was no way poſſible for him to Repent, though their Condition was ſuch, that it was morally impoſſible as I have ſaid, but the far greateſt number of them muſt be loſt for ever.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is very well worth our while to obſerve, that notwithſtanding this blindneſs or hardneſs, yet the <hi>Jews</hi> had all the while a zeal for God; though that zeal was not according to knowledge. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf in the ſincerity of his heart, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> before his Converſion,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93763:108"/> as thinking he did God good Service thereby; which was the caſe of almoſt all the <hi>Jews,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf had foretold it ſhould be. From whence it is eaſie to perceive that the zeal and heat of a Party, let it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much a pretended zeal for God, nay, let it be never ſo ſincere and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in it ſelf, yet it is not always a ſign of truth; but on the contrary, when this zeal for God, is a zeal to divide and break the Unity of the Myſtical body of Chriſt, which is his Church. A zeal without Charity and Brotherly kindneſs. A zeal of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny and ſlander againſt all thoſe that are not of the ſame party with themſelves. A zeal to believe all that may do hurt. And a zeal to report it that it may do the more. A zeal of not reading or hearing what other Men can ſay for themſelves, leſt they ſhould be inſtructed or informed. A zeal that calls Truth and Sobriety car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reaſon. A zeal that will ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt when it has nothing to ſay for its ſelf. A zeal that flies from Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if it were a Wolf in Sheeps-Cloathing; or <hi>Satan</hi> in the ſhape of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93763:109"/> an Angel of light. A zeal againſt the Order, Government, and quiet of the world. A zeal to ſee all things, like it ſelf on fire. A zeal to propogate Religion by Swords, or by Daggers: to conclude, A zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. A zeal of Impudence. And a zeal for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe; this kind of zeal though it ſhould be ſincere, as it is to be feared, that in many it is not: This is not that Chriſtian zeal which diſcovers it ſelf chiefly by Charity, Humility, and mutual Forbearance, by obedience to Superiours, and love to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but it is rather the zeal of thoſe who are given over to a repr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bate Mind, and who after all their magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent and ſwaggering pretences, are in danger of greater Flames than they endeavour to kindle.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I think it very reaſonable to believe, that this hardneſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was the Conſequence of their many and great Sins; and was the occaſion of ſo horrid outrages committed againſt the perſon and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of our Lord, which we ſee no argument how powerful ſoever, had
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93763:109"/> ſufficient ſtrength and efficacy to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was after his Crucifixion ſtill greater than it was before, becauſe it is manifeſt they ſtill perſiſted in the ſame impenitent and obdurate State; and it is equally plain that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which might induce them to a ſenſe and ſight of their Sin, grew e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day more ſtrong and potent than the other. For when the vail of the Temple was rent in ſunder at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of his paſſion, what ſtronger e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence could there poſſibly be given by the divine Power or wiſdome, that this was indeed that <hi>Meſſias</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by their Fathers and themſelves, who was after all their ill grounded Imaginations of a triumphant Prince, after a certain period of time to be <hi>cut off,</hi> and was <hi>to make the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and the oblation to ceaſe?</hi> For when the Vail was torn, and the Holy of Holies laid open, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to every Eye, and conſequently profaned, exaugurated, and unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied again; what could be more plain, than that God did by this deſign to ſignifie the abolition of the <hi>Moſaick</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:93763:110"/> Law, and that he that ſate between the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> which was the reaſon of the extraordinary ſanctity of that place, had now left that Station for good and all, and had forſaken that ancient Seat where his honour had accuſtomed to dwell?</p>
            <p>Again, when after his Crucifixion he roſe again from the dead, which I have ſhown plainly they had all the reaſon in the world very heartily to believe, and yet perſiſted in the ſame, or indeed greater incredulity, becauſe the Convictions were greater than they were before; what can be more reaſonable than to think, that for their not laying hold of the former poſſibilities of Repentance, thoſe poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities grew every day more faint and weak; and that there was leſs hold to be taken of them every day than other?</p>
            <p>Again, when after his Aſcenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, the Holy Ghoſt in the ſight of Multitudes of all ſorts, did upon the day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> deſcend in bodily and viſible ſhapes upon the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> confirming their Miſſion to preach the Goſpel of the crucified <hi>Jeſus</hi> by a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93763:110"/> miraculous gift of Tongues; and when for ever after they were endued with a power of Miracles, and with a gift of Utterance for the more effectual Confirmation of that Goſpel which they were to Preach; and for the more advantagious delivery of it among prejudiced and unequal Hearers, when they acted ſo much above all humane Power, ſpake with a more than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Eloquence, and ſuffered with a Courage inſenſible of humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when they baffled their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, convinced their Judges, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thouſands at the hearing of one Sermon; what ſhall we think, but that they who ſaw all this, who knew and underſtood it all very well to be true and yet did not believe themſelves, but on the contrary perſiſted in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and fanatick zeal againſt all thoſe that did: What ſhall we think, I ſay, or indeed what can we poſſibly conceive to have been the cauſe of ſuch prodigious unbelief, but that for their former Sins, and for their not laying hold of thoſe means, or thoſe poſſibilities of returning to a ſounder mind, which were afforded them;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93763:111"/> they were acted every day more ſtrongly by a ſupernatural Spirit of Incredulity, by the juſt Judgment and decree of an incenſed God, whoſe goodneſs and patience had been ſo much abuſed, the more effectually to hinder them from Repentance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment?</p>
            <p>Nay, When the Oracles grew dumb and ſilent, when the <hi>Devils</hi> were caſt out, not only in <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> but in all the World, when the powers of Darkneſs gave place to the light of the Goſpel, when the City and Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were Demoliſhed, their Altars profaned, their Prieſthood rendred uſeleſs, their Sacrifices not only excuſed, but forbidden, their New-Moons antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, their Solemn Feaſts turned into Faſting and Lamentation. When the Scepter was not only departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> and a Lawgiver from between his feet, which was an infallible Sign that the true <hi>Shiloh</hi> was come, but they were diſperſed and ſcattered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the face of the whole Earth, looked upon as the Scorn and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Mankind: Objects of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93763:111"/> utmoſt hatred and Contempt together, more loathed than their own ſo much abominated Swine, and more unclean than any of thoſe Beaſts that were forbidden them by <hi>Moſes.</hi> When yet after all this there is no Sign appears that their affairs are likely to be in a better Poſture, neither are there any the leaſt reaſonable hopes of the long lookt for <hi>Meſſias</hi> his appearance; when all that have pretended to that high Dignity, our <hi>Jeſus</hi> only excepted, have all of them ſufficiently expoſed their Nation and themſelves; have betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their own Impiety, and the folly of all their Adherents, have lived without Miracles, and died without Pity, leaving nothing but ſhame and confuſion to their <hi>Diſciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, When the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves are forced to confeſs that the time of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> his appearance upon Earth is now long ſince expired, but that he is ſtill denied them, and delays his coming as a puniſhment of their Sins; which reaſon, or rather excuſe, if it be any at all, will be better every Minute than it was before, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a reaſon why the <hi>Meſſias</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:93763:112"/> ſhould never come at all. What can be more plain from ſo great obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy under ſo great Convictions, than that their not believing him to be come already, is at once their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and their Sin together?</p>
            <p>For after all it is by no means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with thoſe Notions which we are uſed, and which we ought all to entertain concerning the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtice; to think that any one <hi>Jew</hi> is or ever was ſo hardly dealt with, that he never was under any the leaſt poſſibility of Salvation; for this were to make Power and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary will, the only Meaſures by which God proceeds in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world: for it is manifeſt, that what he may juſtly do, that is, without any violence to his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes or his Nature to one ſingle <hi>Jew,</hi> that he may do if he pleaſes to the whole Nation, and conſequently to all mankind.</p>
            <p>The Anceſtours of the <hi>Jews</hi> having embrued their guilty hands in the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> may be a reaſon why God may ſubſtract the ſpecial aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Grace and Spirit from their
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93763:112"/> Poſterity, which he is not obliged to vouchſafe in an equal proportion to all Mankind; but it can be none at all why he ſhould deſtroy, or impair thoſe natural Powers and faculties of the Mind, without which it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to know their Duty; neither is any thing indeed a Duty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further than it is or may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by them to be ſo. Their Fathers were hardened and blinded for their own Tranſgreſſions, but the Children are not ſo dealt with for the Iniquities of the Fathers, which would be unjuſt, becauſe no man can help his Fathers having been a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, and no Man ought to be puniſhed for what he could not avoid; but all the Buſineſs is, God may, as I have ſaid, withdraw the ſpecial Aſſiſtances of his Grace, which he is not obliged to vouchſafe to any, much leſs to the Poſterity of thoſe who have been the moſt Notorious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt him; and he may take the forfeiture of their own proper Sins (which he may juſtly do at any time when ever he pleaſes) ſooner than he would have done, had their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93763:113"/> Anceſtours pleaſed him better, which is plainly the meaning of that known place. <hi>Exod. 20. 5, 6. I the Lord thy God, am a jealous God, viſiting the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities of the Fathers, upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, unto the third and fourth Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of them that hate me, and ſhew Mercy unto Thouſands, of them that love me, and keep my Commandments.</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew, it is to them that hate me, and to them that keep my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> and ſo the 70. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Now if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what is meant by <hi>Gods Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the Iniquities of the Fathers, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Children unto the third and fourth Generation, to them that hate him:</hi> the true anſwer I ſuppoſe, on all hands will be agreed to be, that he puniſhes the Poſterity for the ſake of thoſe that went before them; and ſo on the other ſide, <hi>his ſhewing Mercy unto Thouſands to them that love him,</hi> muſt be meant both by the rule of oppoſition, and by Analogy of Interpretation, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> particle in both caſes being
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93763:113"/> the ſame, <hi>of his ſhewing Mercy for the ſake of thoſe that love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, If it be demanded, how or in what ſenſe it is, <hi>that God ſhews Mercy to Thouſands for the ſake of them that love him,</hi> the Anſwer will be and muſt be, not that he will ever ſuffer Sin, aggravated by impenitence and wilful perſeverance to eſcape wholly unpuniſhed, for the ſake of any man let him be never ſo Holy: this would be a Doctrine very deſtructive to all manner of piety and goodneſs among Men, and very inconſiſtent with the divine Juſtice, Nay, and with his Mercy too; if you conſider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would be tempted by ſuch a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Sin againſt him, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe themſelves and others: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the meaning muſt be, that he will not be ſo ſevere, <hi>to mark what is done amiſs,</hi> with the progeny of thoſe that have endeavoured faithfully to <hi>ſerve and love him, and to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;</hi> but will for their ſakes bear with them much longer, than otherwiſe he would have done; he will give them farther time, and more Opportunities, greater Aſſiſtances, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93763:114"/> more powerful Convictions that they may Repent, and to render them the more ungrateful and the more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, if they do not; and ſo on the other hand, <hi>he will viſit the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children,</hi> that is, not that he will inflict any poſitive and real Puniſhment, which otherwiſe it had not been lawful for him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, meerly becauſe of the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Fathers, which can no more be the fault or action of the Children, than the perſon of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, can be the perſon of the Child; but there are ſome things which God may do by virtue of his Deſpotical power, as he is the ſupream Lord and Soveraign of all, and there are others which he may do as an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his Juſtice.</p>
            <p>To the firſt Head there are two things belonging.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Subſtraction of all, but ſo much neceſſary and indiſpenſible Grace, without which it is impoſſible for us in this degenerate and lapſed Eſtate, either to withſtand the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Temptations, or to repent ſo effectually for having yielded to them,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93763:114"/> as is neceſſary for the attainment of eternal Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The inflicting all thoſe pains of Body, Calamities in our Fortune, or Diſappointments as to our Deſigns, which are not leſs eligible than non-entity it ſelf, but where there is either a mixture of preſent enjoyment to make the pain more To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, or an interval of indolency to make it leſs Laſting, or a ſtrength of mind that is able to combat with pain or with Misfortune, and reaps ſome inward Satisfaction from the conqueſt to it ſelf; or Laſtly, a ground of hope that ſuch unhappy Circumſtances will have a more pleaſing and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Concluſion.</p>
            <p>In this caſe it is plain, that what God may do without any violence to his Juſtice, by virtue of his Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power and will, for no reaſon at all, but meerly becauſe it ſo pleaſes him, that he may do the ſooner and the rather when he has a reaſon for it; though that reaſon may not be founded in the perſon himſelf, on whom this Calamity is inflicted; but in that of him of whom he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93763:115"/> who having been a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of wickedneſs, and of Diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty againſt him; he may for his ſake exerciſe his Soveraignty and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon his Poſterity, ſooner or with more Severity than he would otherwiſe have allowed himſelf to do, though he might have done it not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if it had ſo pleaſed him; and therefore it is an act of Mercy when ever he does it not.</p>
            <p>As when the <hi>Diſciples</hi> demanded of our <hi>Saviour, John 9. 2. Maſter, who did Sin, this Man or his Parents, that he was born blind? Jeſus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red neither hath this Man ſinned, nor his Parents; but that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him.</hi> Where our <hi>Saviour</hi> grants that ſuch a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as <hi>Blindneſs,</hi> being indeed no great infelicity to one who was never acquainted with the advantages of <hi>Sight,</hi> might juſtly have been inflicted, for the ſake, and upon the account of his Father's Sin; becauſe whatever God may do for no reaſon at all, that it is certain he may do much more at any time for a reaſon, how ſmall ſoever that reaſon be: However in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93763:115"/> this inſtance he ſays plainly, that it was not for any Sin of his Parents, but it was an Exerciſe of Gods deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Power; and this <hi>Blindneſs</hi> was the rather inflicted upon him, that after ſuch a period of time he might be healed: and by a miraculous reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his ſight give an atteſtation to the truth of our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Doctrine, to the reality of his Miſſion, and to the divinity of his Perſon: <hi>Neither hath this man ſinned, nor his Parents, but that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him;</hi> where it is true, that he was at length healed, and conſequently in the General was made <hi>Blind,</hi> that the works of God might be made manifeſt in him: but that he was kept <hi>Blind</hi> ſo long from the time of his Birth, till he came to Man's Eſtate, this was an exerciſe of deſpotical Power, ſince itis plain that the ſame works of God might have been made manifeſt in a Child of a year, or two years old, who had been <hi>Blind</hi> from the Womb for all that time.</p>
            <p>This Soveraignty and abſolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of God over his Creatures,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93763:116"/> which conſiſts in a right of taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all that he hath given, or in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting all thoſe Calamities upon us, which are not more dreadful to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane opinion or Imagination than non-entity it ſelf is acknowledged by <hi>Job,</hi> when the terrible Judgments there mentioned had devoured all his ſubſtance, and deſtroyed all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, leaving him deſtitute of all things for which life is deſirable, <hi>c. 1. 20, 21. Then Job aroſe and rent his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ſhaved his head, and fell down upon the ground and worſhipped, and ſaid Naked came I out of my Mothers womb, and Naked ſhall I return thither; the Lord gave, and the Lord taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Bleſſed be the name of the Lord:</hi> and then it follows, <hi>v. 22. In all this Job ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> which it ſeems by this place he had done, if after this ſevere uſage he had charged God with injuſtice. And what was true as to thoſe goods of Life, which are external to a Man's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſuch as are his Children and his Subſtance, which it has been ſhewn, may without injuſtice be taken away by God, by virtue of his abſolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93763:116"/> over men, the ſame is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe acknowledged to be no leſs true by the ſame illuſtrious example of an humble Reſignation to the will of the great Diſpoſer; as to thoſe things in which a Man's own proper perſon is more nearly concerned: For when <hi>Satan</hi> had ſmitten <hi>Job</hi> with ſore Blanes and Boils, equally loathſome and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful all over his Body, <hi>from the crown of his Head, to the ſole of his Foot, c. 2. v.</hi> 7. and when his Wife upon ſo ſuddain occaſion, <hi>v.</hi> 9, ſaid unto him: <hi>Doſt thou ſtill retain thine Integrity? Curſe God and Dye;</hi> he makes no other Anſwer, <hi>v.</hi> 10, but, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh Women ſpeaketh, What? ſhall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive Evil?</hi> and then it follows again, <hi>in all this did not Job ſin with his lips.</hi> Thus far there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is Sin to accuſe God of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
            <p>But this is not all neither, but it is ſtill further true by Authority, as great and as ſacred as that of the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> and by the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful, and the friend of God; that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93763:117"/> this ſame abſolute Dominion extends it ſelf as far as to Life it ſelf, which it is at God's pleaſure to take away by arbitrary meaſures without being accountable to his own Juſtice or his goodneſs for it.</p>
            <p>For though it be indeed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation of that Righteous Perſon, with his Maker in the behalf of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Gen. 18. v. 23, 25. Wilt thou alſo deſtroy the Righteous with the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? that be far from thee, to do after this manner, to ſlay the Righteous with the Wicked, that be far from thee, ſhall not the Judge of all the Earth do Right?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though it be further true that as a Judge, God cannot ſlay the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with the Wicked, becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering him in that Capacity, he muſt act according to the reſpective de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of thoſe that appear before him at his Tribunal; yet as a proprietor and Soveraign Lord he may, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in truth the only proper exerciſe of his Soveraignty and abſolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over us.</p>
            <p>But yet notwithſtanding, how cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever he preſſed this argument
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93763:117"/> with his God, he did not dare for all that to interceed any further, than that if there were <hi>ten Righteous</hi> to be found in the City, he would be pleaſed to ſpare it for their ſakes; therefore by his own Conceſſion, and as it were, in Complyince with that agreement and Stipulation which was at that time made betwixt God and himſelf, he might juſtly have involved <hi>nine Righteous</hi> perſons in the common Calamity of that wicked place; but he that may juſtly ſlay nine innocent perſons, or at leaſt, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, for Juſtice ſuppoſeth a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſequently a fault, may likewiſe without any injuſtice ſlay nine Millions, or an infinite number, if it ſo pleaſeth him; for the injuſtice is not to be fetched from the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but from the nature of the fact, which if it be once lawful, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be repeated ſo often as to make it otherwiſe than it is in it ſelf: ſo that if he may deſtroy one innocent man without injuſtice, it is manifeſt there can be no reaſon, why he may not do the ſame to another, and ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> it being utterly impoſſible
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93763:118"/> to ſet any Bounds or Limits to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this power.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem ſomething hard, to involve good Men in thoſe Calamities, which the Sins of the bad have given caſion to; but it is next kin to an impoſſibility in this great Ship of the world, where all Men's Concerns and Intereſts are carried together in the ſame Bottom, and are ſo ſtrangely perplexed and entangled with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but the <hi>Righteous</hi> muſt needs partake in the ſufferings of the <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> Nay, it is abſolutely impoſſible as to Men's Fortunes or Intereſts or Affairs in the world, but it muſt of neceſſity be ſo: and as to the taking away of their lives, or viſiting them with any loathſome or painful Diſeaſe, though it be not equally neceſſary that this ſhould light in common as well as the other, yet it is by no means inconſiſtent with the Juſtice or goodneſs of God that it ſhould be ſo. God is not obliged, when he viſiteth any Nation or pepple with a Plague or Epidemical Diſeaſe, to order the matter ſo that the deſtroying Angel ſhall pick his way and make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93763:118"/> as he goes betwixt the good and bad, ſuch a choice as this would be contrary to the very nature of the Judgment it ſelf, which is as blind and impartial as the Grave to which it ſends us; and therefore that ſtroke which with reſpect to the wicked is a Puniſhment, is in relation to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort of Men, an exerciſe of that power which may juſtly take away all that it hath given us, without doing the leaſt wrong or injury at all, and this muſt needs extend as far as life it ſelf; which together with all the Comforts and enjoyments that are conſequent upon it, is the immediate and only gift of God, who is the ſole proprietor of that vital warmth which awakens the ſtupid matter into an enjoyment of it ſelf, and from whom as from the root of life, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſource of all the inferiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive powers, that long meander of Energy and vital activity is derived that paſſes thorough all the ſpatious Provinces of this ſame Secondary, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated World, watering the ſenſeleſs matter as it goes, with an enlivening and refreſhing ſtream.</p>
            <pb n="168" facs="tcp:93763:119"/>
            <p>Thus much may be ſufficient to have ſaid concerning the lawful exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of God's deſpotical or arbitrary power: I come now to conſider what he may do as an exerciſe of his Juſtice, and I lay it down for a certain and ſelf-evident Maxim, that he cannot blind or harden Men from the Cradle all along to the day of their Death, in order to their final Deſtruction and Damnation in the other world, becauſe the pains of that miſerable State being ſuppoſed to be infinite, both in degree and in duration; one of theſe two things muſt be granted, either that God can do no wrong, let him do what he will or can, what ever is moſt cruel or ſeems moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, but that he is nothing elſe but arbitrary will, and that infinite Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty is ſufficiently warranted and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by infinite power, which is Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine, and the avow'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Mr. <hi>Hobbs;</hi> or elſe that in all inſtanc es of this nature where he firſt concludes men under a miſerable and fatal neceſſity of doing what they do, and then damns them for doing or believing what they could not avoid
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93763:119"/> to do or to believe, he is guilty of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Injuſtice; one of theſe two things, I ſay, muſt be granted, for there is no medium betwixt them.</p>
            <p>But now as to the firſt of them, I do affirm it to be falſe, for two reaſons; the firſt of which is taken from the teſtimony of Scripture, the other from the nature of God; it remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the latter muſt of neceſſity be true.</p>
            <p>And firſt to argue from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Scripture, in the expoſtulation of <hi>Abraham</hi> with his Maker, of which we have ſo lately ſpoken, <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> It is plainly intimated that there are ſome things that God cannot do, otherwiſe this would be a very impertinent, and a very ridiculous Expoſtulation; and ſo in that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 9. 14. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? Is there unrighteouſneſs with God? God forbid,</hi>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93763:120"/> told us, that Juſtice is only a name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and Man, or a politick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance for the better order and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, becauſe Men cannot ſubſiſt without one anothers help, they receive equal benefit, and are in equal danger from one another; and ſo it was neceſſary for the better preſervation of Mankind, and for the comfort and ſupport of humane life, that there ſhould be here and there a daſh of Juſtice to reſtrain Men's paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and qualifie their deſires, and to temper and allay ſuch exorbitant and giddy Fumes as thoſe of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> and of <hi>Geneva,</hi> but that indeed Juſtice was only a matter of Relative neceſſity, not of real or intrinſick goodneſs, and that none are unjuſt, but they who want power to vindicate what they have done.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is connected with that famous inſtance of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau, v. 12. 13. It was ſaid unto her, the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger, as it is written, Jacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated:</hi> Which inſtance, as well as that of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently cleared in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,

            <p>Let us therefore conſider what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in another place, <hi>Gal. 4. v. 22. ad 27. It is written, that Abraham had two Sons, the one by a Bond-maid, the other by a Free-woman; but he who was of the Bond-woman was born after the Fleſh, but he of the Free-woman was by promiſe, which things are an Allegory; for theſe are the two Covenants, the one from Mount Sinai, which gendreth to Bondage, which is Agar; for this Agar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and anſwereth to Jeruſalem which now is, and is in Bondage with her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but Jeruſalem which is above is free, which is the Mother of us all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which we ſee plainly, not only that the Law it ſelf, and all the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93763:121"/> ſcrupuloſity belonging to it, was a type and ſhadow of a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Diſpenſation to come; but alſo that the very perſons and actions mention'd in the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, had ſometimes a typical deſignment in them; which notion will receive yet farther advantage, when upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial enquiry into that matter we ſhall find, that what St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid of <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> and their reſpective Off-ſprings <hi>Jſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> may with equal, if not greater, probability of truth, to all outward appearance I mean, be applied to the perſons of <hi>Eſau</hi> and of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 22, 23. When <hi>the Children ſtrugled within the Womb of Rebecca, and ſhe went to enquire of the Lord;</hi> The Anſwer ſhe received was this: <hi>Two Nations are in thy Womb, and two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of people ſhall be ſeparated from thy Bowels, and the one people ſhall be ſtronger than the other people, and the elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> Where the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the two manner of people, are the two diſpenſations of the Law and Goſpel, which were of a nature ſo ſtrangely different from one another,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93763:122"/> the one all ceremonious and outward, the other all ſimple, plain, and inward; neither will it be an eaſie matter in any other ſenſe but this, to give a fair expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of what follows, that the one people ſhall be ſtronger than the other people, or that the elder ſhall ſerve the younger; but only that the Goſpel ſhould prevail over the Law, that the latter ſhould be ſubſervient to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and be <hi>the Schoolmaſter to bring us unto Chriſt,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf calls it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> were Typical perſons, and had a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical deſignment with reſpect to the Evangelical Diſpenſation, is clear; beſides, that their Names and their Hiſtories do ſufficiently ſpeak for themſelves, from the expreſs teſtimony of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 9. 6, 7, 8. They are not all Iſrael which are of Iſrael, neither becauſe they are the Seed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham are they all Children; but in Iſaac ſhall thy Seed be called, that is, they which are the Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God; but the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the promiſe are counted for the Seed.</hi> And <hi>Gal. 3. 29.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93763:122"/> then are ye Abraham's Seed and Heirs according to the promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, that the very loving of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hating of <hi>Eſau,</hi> was not ſo Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary a thing as is commonly ſuppoſed, but was at leaſt founded upon Typical or Prophetick reaſons, ſeems clear to me from the teſtimony of St. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Rom. 9. 11, 12. For the Children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpoſe of God, according to Election, might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth, it was ſaid unto her</hi> (Rebecca) <hi>the elder ſhall ſerve the younger:</hi> As much as to ſay, that God made a diſtinction where there was really none, as to the Children themſelves, but only they were both of them Typical perſons, the one was a type or ſhadow of the Moſaick diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, the other of that of Chriſt, and the difference put between them was intended to ſhew us, that by the works of the Law, or by an exact obedience, which is morally impoſſible, no man ſhall be juſtified; but that after all we muſt owe our happineſs not to our ſelves, but to him that calleth, that is, to the mercy and grace of God in and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93763:123"/> through the merits of his Son, apply'd to us by a ſtedfaſt and lively Faith upon the Evangelical condition of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and that upon ſuch terms as theſe, God will <hi>call</hi> us, that is, he will do that as an act of Mercy, which as an act of Juſtice he was not obliged to do.</p>
            <p>To the ſame purpoſe are the next words, as hath been ſaid already, <hi>It was ſaid unto her, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger:</hi> For you cannot fairly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it in any other ſenſe but this, That the Oeconomy of the Law was to be ſubſervient to, and was to uſher in that nobler and more perfect diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Goſpel, of which, and of the ſufferings of Chriſt who purchaſed that advantagious Covenant for us with his Blood, the Ceremonies and Sacrifices of the Law were plainly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificative and expreſſive: For it is clear, notwithſtanding this, that <hi>Jacob,</hi> together with his Wives and Children, did afterwards pay that homage and obedience to his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> which by the cuſtom of thoſe times, was uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given to the elder Brother, and is very inconſiſtent with that temporal
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93763:123"/> Dominion, which is pretended by this Bleſſing of <hi>Iſaac</hi> to be conferred upon his younger Son <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 33.</p>
            <p>Beſides in the bleſſing, if it may be called one, which <hi>Iſaac</hi> beſtowed upon <hi>Eſau</hi> we find theſe words, <hi>Gen. 27. 4. By thy Sword ſhalt thou live, and ſhalt ſerve thy Brother;</hi> which two things taken both of them in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral and firſt Senſe are inconſiſtent with one another. For to live by the Sword, is to live by Conqueſt, by Rapine and Spoile; and to Serve is to live in Subjection and to obey. It is neceſſary therefore that they be underſtood in different Senſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince, without a manifeſt Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is impoſſible to expound them both the ſame way; <hi>by thy Sword ſhalt thou live,</hi> that is, thou ſhalt be the Father of Warlike and predatory Nations, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Nations that live upon Spoile and Rapine without regard to Equity or Juſtice; that is, perhaps, of the <hi>Arabs, Turks,</hi> or <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> all whoſe originals at this day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon very obſcure Conjectures, and they may either one or more of theſe people owe their diſcent to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93763:124"/> 
               <hi>Eſau,</hi> as well as to any other. But then <hi>thou ſhalt ſerve thy Brother;</hi> neither muſt nor can be underſtood in the ſame way, and the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of it is at this day manifeſtly true, but it is to be underſtood, not of his Poſterity, but his Perſon; which as I have ſhown, was Typically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignative of that State of the Church, which was to be ſubſervient to and introductive of the more noble and laſting Eſtabliſhment of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>All which may be ſtill further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from the ſtory of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the Son of <hi>Hagar,</hi> of whom the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Lord gives this Character, <hi>Gen. 16. 12. He will be a wild man, his hand will be againſt every man, and every man's hand againſt him,</hi> which is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of his Poſterity, he being generally thought, and that by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves who call them <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maelim,</hi> or <hi>Iſhmaelites,</hi> to be the Father of the <hi>Turks</hi> of whom this Character is exactly true, which <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maelites</hi> may alſo, for ought we know, be the ſame with the <hi>Edomites</hi> or Sons of <hi>Eſau</hi> too, that is to ſay, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of <hi>Eſau by his Wife Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lath
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93763:124"/> the Daughter of Iſhmael, Gen.</hi> 28. 9.</p>
            <p>But now notwithſtanding, he was to rule and to be ſo powerful, that all the reſt of Mankind would ſcarce be an equal match for him, which is the caſe of the <hi>Turks</hi> at this Day; yet whatever he was in his Poſterity, in himſelf he was the Son of a Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman and a Servant, a perſon Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical of the legal Adminiſtration, which was in time to be rejected, to make way for the Son of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, that is to ſay, the Goſpel, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> the deſcendant of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the rightful Heir of all things was to bring into the world. For <hi>Hagar</hi> and conſequently <hi>Iſhmael</hi> her Son, is as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> that is to ſay, the legal diſpenſation, and as the perſons of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſo likewiſe thoſe of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> too had a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the one to the natural ſeed, the other to the Children of the promiſe, according to that place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cited. <hi>Rom. 9. 8.

            <p>Again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 40.

            <p>

            <pb n="183" facs="tcp:93763:126"/>
            <p>Further the <hi>Pottage</hi> being red, was a Type of that Religion that conſiſted mainly in the obſervation of Days and Times, which in ancient as well mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Calendars were uſed to be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with red Letters, and from hence he had his name <hi>Edom, Gen.</hi> 25. 30.

            <p>
               <hi>Eſau's</hi> being rough, and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſmooth, ſignified the intricacy and perplexity of the legal, and the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and honeſt plainneſs of the Evangelical Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jacob</hi> his name was called <hi>Iſrael</hi> from God's appearing to him in <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> which is one reaſon aſſigned of that name, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 9, 10.

            <p>Farther, the hairyneſs of <hi>Eſau</hi> was a ſign of that Religion, which was to be ſetled and preſerved by force and violence, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by the utter extirpation of ſo many Nations, and as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Eſtabliſhment did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour afterwards in the beginnings of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to maintain it ſelf by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</p>

            <p>This may alſo be the ſignification of his name <hi>Edom,</hi> which carries along with it the notion of Blood and Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with alluſion to this notion it is uſed, <hi>Eſa. 63. 1, 2, 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who is this that

I have trodden the Wine Preſs alone, and of the people there was none with me; For I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury, and their Blood ſhall be ſprinkled upon my Garments, and I will ſtain all my Rayment;</hi> as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the ſmoothneſs of <hi>Jacob</hi> was an Emblem of the calmneſs and benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the peaceable and gentle nature of the Goſpel, which is likewiſe inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in his name <hi>Jacob,</hi> to ſhew the ſupplanting and inſinuating power of Truth, which does prevail upon Men's minds without violence, by perſwaſion and gentle means.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the hairyneſs of <hi>Eſau</hi> was to ſignifie the ferine or animal Life, and portended the promulgation of that Law, all whoſe promiſes were Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and belonging to this lower ſtate, being a ſort of ſenſual and inferiour gratifications; as on the other ſide, the ſmoothneſs of <hi>Jacob</hi> was the humane Nature properly ſo called, whoſe ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end looks farther than this life,

            <p>Thus I have proved, beyond all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of anſwer from the Authority of Scripture, that there are ſome things which God cannot lawfully do; and if there be any thing at all to which the exerciſe of his power does not extend, it muſt be the condemning of Watches and Sun-dyals to eternal Torments, for ſuch are all Men who are acted either by an external fate, or by an internal neceſſity of nature, being no more able to avoid what they do, than the hand of the Watch can help obeying the motions of the Springs and Wheels that are within, or than the Sun-dyal can reſiſt the influences of the Sun, or help diſcovering the time of day, when the Sun ſhines directly upon it; and if the Watch be down, you muſt not blame that, but its Keeper, that it does not inform you what it is a Clock; if
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93763:128"/> the Sun does not ſhine, you muſt not blame the <hi>Gnomon</hi> for not caſting the ſhadow upon the hour of the day: if the Watch when it is wound up will not go right, or the Sun-dyal, when the Sun ſhines never ſo bright and full upon it, will not go ſo exactly as the Pariſh Clock: you may blame the Artificer that made them if you pleaſe, but them you cannot, becauſe they are perfectly paſſive in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and can no more repreſent things otherwiſe than they do, than Stones can fly upwards, or ſmoak deſcend to the Center of the Earth.</p>
            <p>I have proved likewiſe that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> of which the predeſtinarian parly is ſo fond, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to the purpoſe; and that though the preferring of <hi>Jacob</hi> before <hi>Eſau</hi> was Arbitrary as to their perſon conſidered barely in themſelves, yet, as theſe perſons were Typical of things to come, there was a deſign in it, and it had at leaſt a prophetical and myſtick meaning: and though this difference put between them were never ſo Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, yet, if you exclude the Type and Myſtery which was hid under it, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93763:129"/> only temporal Bleſſings, in which after all, it does not appear that <hi>Eſau</hi> was ever exceeded by his Brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> and at this day it is certain, the contrary is true. And what is all this to abſolute Reprobation?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I have proved, that thoſe Chapters to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which are the main Pillars on which <hi>Calviniſm</hi> pretends to ſtand, are ſo far from giving Countenance to any ſuch perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Doctrine, that on the contrary they afford very ſtrong and very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Arguments againſt it.</p>
            <p>I will now add, that if what Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> himſelf hath acknowledged be true,<note place="margin">Inſtit. l. 3. c. 25. ſ. 12.</note> That the pains of the damned in the world to come do not conſiſt in thoſe bodily Torments by which they are deſcribed in Scripture, but that they are the effects only of a conſtant ſenſe of the Divine diſpleaſure, and of a troubleſom and uneaſie reflection upon the miſdeeds &amp; enormities of this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life; then, if the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be true, it is utterly impoſſible for any one Man to be damned, ſince God can never be diſpleaſed with perfect
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93763:129"/> innocence, which is the condition of all Men who are acted by an irreſiſtible fate; and ſince it is equally impoſſible, if they continue of the ſame opinion in the World to come, which they would be thought to eſpouſe and patronize in this, (<hi>viz.</hi> that all their actions whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or bad, are owing either to an irreſiſtible corruption, or an irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible grace) that they ſhould ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect with any thing of trouble, diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or guilt upon thoſe actions, which themſelves will then look upon to have been ſo wholly fatal, that they will ſeem to themſelves to have been meerly paſſive in all that they have done; nay, to have been overborn by a neceſſity ſo uncontroulable, that it equals, if not ſurpaſſes, the brutality of the Beaſts that periſh, ſo uncontroula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that there is perpetual need of an irreſiſtible Grace to keep the world in any tolerable order or quiet, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the worſt of Men from being worſe than he is: which opinion, how horrid and how execrably monſtrous ſoever it may ſeem, yet it is not only defended by Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, but it is alſo of abſolute neceſſity to be maintained by
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93763:130"/> all that would truly aſſert the <hi>Calvini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi> Doctrine; becauſe if Men be acted through the whole courſe of their lives by a meer fatality, without the leaſt mixture or contemperation of freedom, then it is certain that all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Agents do and muſt always act to the utmoſt of their reſpective ſtrengths and powers; as the Fire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but burn, and the Smoak cannot help aſcending; Watches muſt go 'till they be down, and Clocks muſt ſtrike at the beginning of the hour; the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt flow, if it be not kept out by Banks or other eminencies intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, into all places that are beneath its level; the Sun always ſhines as much as it can, gives as much light and heat, draws as many Exhalations, ripens as many Fruits, and as much as it is able. And if Mankind be managed by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity equal to that with which theſe Agents are actuated and inſpired, if there be in Men nothing elſe but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and perpetual propenſity to all manner of evil; and if this propenſity have no inward principle of choice or freedom whereby to regulate it ſelf, if it know no temper, and be incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93763:130"/> of any moderation, then it muſt always act to the utmoſt of its force, activity and power: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this propenſity being in all the very ſame, every Man muſt be as bad as it is poſſible for any Man to be, and it muſt be owing only to an irreſiſtible grace that Men do not tear and devour one another, and that all manner of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs is not committed publickly in our Streets, in the ſight of Multitudes, and in the face of the Sun.</p>
            <p>But if there be on the other ſide ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the leaſt blending or mixture of Freedom with this Neceſſity, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt at firſt ſight, that this freedom is a principle capable of improvement, it may exert it ſelf by a conſtant and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual endeavour into ſtill higher and higher degrees of ſelf-activity and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion; and being aſſiſted by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful encouragements of God's holy Spirit, which is never wanting to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh all good motions in us, theſe ſparks of Virtue and Religion, which are thus careful to preſerve themſelves, will be awakened into a vigorous and lively flame: by which means it will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably come to paſs, that the <hi>Calvini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:93763:131"/> Hypotheſis will be utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, there being no Man, if we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thus much, who may not be in ſome poſſibility of Salvation.</p>
            <p>It is plain therefore as any thing can poſſibly be, that the Doctrine of <hi>Calvin</hi> and his Followers is inconſiſtent with it ſelf: For firſt, it damns and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates the far greateſt part of Mankind, and yet notwithſtanding, introduces ſuch a fatality into all humane Actions as is perfectly inconſiſtent with Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and not with Damnation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with Salvation too: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſtate and condition of the damned be, it is certain that the joys of Heaven can conſiſt in nothing elſe, but in a ſerene and healthful conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of body and mind, reſulting from a pleaſant ſenſe of the favour of God, and from a no leſs comfortable reflection upon our ſteady and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſed behaviour in the midſt of all the dangerous temptations and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this mortal life; or laſtly, from the Spirits of the juſt, in both of theſe reſpects, eternally congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and bleſſing one another. But nothing is more evident than that God
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93763:131"/> cannot be pleaſed with us for doing what we could not poſſibly avoid; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we be pleaſed with our ſelves for being irreſiſtibly acted by another. So that <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> let it pretend to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great attainments of purity and truth, does yet in reality overthrow that Religion, of which it would be thought the only ground and pillar; it perfectly deſtroys the being of any future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment or reward, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence baniſhes all manner of Religion and Virtue out of the World.</p>
            <p>There is a very plain and a very cloſe connexion betwixt the liberty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions, and the rewards and puniſhments of a future State, there being nothing more inconſiſtent with a merciful Being, as God is repreſented in Scripture to be, nor more repugnant to thoſe common notions which all Mankind is uſed to entertain concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Divine Goodneſs, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Men with ſuch a ſelf-moving Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of choice and freedom, in the midſt of ſo many and ſo great Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, as we are daily and hourly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed and ſurrounded with, and to the wrong uſe of which freedom,

               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:93763:133"/> moſt of the miſeries and calamities incident to Mankind are owing, if it were not that we are ſent into this World, as into a ſtate of Tryal, where there being many dangers and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to encounter with, there muſt be a ſuitable reward annext to the conqueſt of them; otherwiſe the condition of Mankind would be much more hard than of any other part of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it would ſeem as if God had ſent them into the World, only that he might triumph over the infirmities, and ſport himſelf in the miſery of his Creatures: for this, as I have ſaid, is the uſual effect of that freedom for which I am now contending.</p>
            <p>But now, if at the end of this Race there be a Prize propoſed, if this labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Combat, which we are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obliged to maintain with ſo many unruly Luſts and headſtrong Paſſions, be but to fit and refine our tempers for the enjoyment of a better and a more exalted condition of life; nay, if the very nature of that happineſs do in a great meaſure conſiſt in a comfortable remembrance of, and reflexion upon that ſucceſsful Conflict, which we in
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:93763:133"/> this life have maintained with the brutiſh and beaſtly part of our ſelves, then all is made good ſenſe again, and here is a very clear account given of the reaſon of that ſpontaneous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which we find within our ſelves, and of its Connexion with the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſery of another Life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, if all humane actions be neceſſary and fatal, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of rewards and puniſhments is utterly deſtroy'd: For though a Man may be plagued or tormented, yet he can never properly be ſaid to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for what he could not avoid; for all puniſhment is either for the amendment of the offending party, or for an example to others: Now where there is no fault, there can be no amendment; and where there is no choice, there can be no fault.</p>
            <p>Again, that Calamity which being inflicted upon one, is intended for an example to others, muſt have its effect upon us, either by the way of a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motive, or of a neceſſary cauſe; if the firſt, that ſuppoſes that freedom for which we contend, for deliberation without freedom is the greateſt non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:93763:134"/> in the world: if the latter, then I demand, whether before the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this neceſſary cauſe there were an Antecedent liberty or no; if you ſay there was, then I do by no means underſtand, why the puniſhment of one or more voluntary Agents ſhould deſtroy the freedom of all Mankind, invert the order of things, and alter the natural conſtitution of the world; and if you will not grant it, then here are two contrary neceſſities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with one another, as a Body moved any determinate way, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſame motion, and the ſame determination, if it be not hindered from purſuing its courſe, and turned another way by another more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than it ſelf, whether quieſcent or in motion, which it ſhall meet or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in its paſſage: but then how ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe determinations ſhall be either culpable or meritorious, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing which I do not underſtand, and I am afraid it will puzzle a wiſer head to give a tolerable account of it.</p>
            <p>Again, the pains of the Damned in the life to come, conſiſt, as I have ſaid, in a great meaſure to be certain, in a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93763:134"/> troubleſom and uneaſie remembrance of the miſcarriages of this: But how can I be troubled for what I could not avoid? Or if I may be troubled, yet it is plain I am troubled without reaſon, and conſequently this is but the effect of another neceſſity, and ſo here is one neceſſity puniſhed by another, which is certainly the moſt unreaſonable, and the moſt unjuſt thing in the world; ſo that we muſt unavoidably grant, either that there can be no ſuch thing as Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or that this is that very thing, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated with all the circumſtances that can make it moſt unworthy of God, or moſt hateful to Men. For here is the greateſt injury and the greateſt deceit together, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt injury for a Man to be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all Eternity for what he could not avoid, and the greateſt deceit for a Man to think all the while that he might have acted otherwiſe than he has; for that is the caſe of every Man who is poſſeſſed with a ſenſe of Guilt, Repentance, or Shame.</p>
            <p>For what is Shame but a troubleſom reflexion upon Folly? And how can Folly and Neceſſity be conſiſtent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93763:135"/> What is Guilt but a certain pain and anguiſh of the Mind ariſing from a ſenſe of Sin? And how can that Action be ſinful which it was not in our power to eſchew? Or why may we not as well conclude, that the Sun commits a Sin when it parches the Earth with an immoderate heat? Or the Rain when it poaches it with intemperate ſhowres? What room can there be for ſuch a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as Repentance, where there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be repented of? And how can any Man repent of that, which it was utterly impoſſible for him to avoid? And which being placed in the ſame circumſtances, he muſt with the ſame neceſſity act over again?</p>
            <p>There are thoſe whoſe dejection of Spirit is ſo great, under the perpetual weight and preſſure of misfortune, that they curſe the unhappy day wherein they were born into a World ſo full of miſery and ſorrow; but there are none repent their being born, becauſe Repentance is a reflection upon a Man's own action, not upon the action of our Parents, or upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> No Man can be ſaid to repent that he was born blind, or that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93763:135"/> he became ſo by the virulence of a Diſtemper which it was not in his power to prevent, he may wiſh it had been otherwiſe, or he may be ſorry that it was not; but this deſire, or this ſorrow of his, is not accompany'd with a ſenſe of guilt or ſhame, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways requiſite to fill up the notion, and conſtitute the nature of Repentance. No Man repents his having had the Rickets in his Childhood, or his being afflicted with the Gout in his old Age, ſo far as theſe Diſtempers depend upon ſpermatick and hereditary Cauſes; but if by Lewdneſs and Intemperance he ſhall contract a crazy and infirm habit of Body, and ſhall derive a ſickly and diſeaſed Conſtitution down to his Iſſue, then he may and has reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for his own ſake, and for theirs too to whom he is the occaſion of ſo great misfortune; he muſt needs look back with bluſhes and confuſion of face upon his own perſonal follies, and it will be ſtill a farther aggravation to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his mind, that he has poiſon'd Ages and Generations to come, that his name ſhall either periſh with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or dye together with his Children,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:93763:136"/> or live with infamy and diſgrace in the infirmity of thoſe that ſhall ſucceed them.</p>
            <p>What hath been ſaid concerning Guilt, Repentance, and Shame, paſſions that do unavoidably ſuppoſe and prove a freedom, the ſame is likewiſe appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the buſineſs of Temptation: <hi>Watch and pray</hi> (ſaid our Bleſſed Lord to his Diſciples) <hi>that ye enter not into Temptation,</hi> Mat. 26. 41. But now in all Temptations, liberty is plainly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; for if a Man cannot yield, how is he tempted? And if he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, it is more than a Temptation. So that the nature of a Temptation evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrates a power, either of yielding or reſiſting in him to whom it is offered, but this power can never be conceived without a conceſſion of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Again St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Epiſt. 1. <hi>c. 10. v. 13. There hath no Temptation taken you, but ſuch as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Man: But God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that ye are able, but will with the Temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi> Will he
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93763:136"/> ſo? will he enable us to bear it? but how will he bring this good Effect to paſs? why he will do it partly by the natural Powers, and Faculties which he has given us, and partly by the bleſſed Influences of his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and good Spirit, infuſed into our Hearts, and ſtrengthning the natural force and activity of our Minds. But yet after all this, we muſt make our eſcape our ſelves; he will ſtrengthen us with ſufficient might in the inward Man, whereby to repel the aſſault of any Temptation, but yet he does not ſo ſtrengthen us as to deſtroy that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by which we are ſtill in a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of yielding: and if there were not ſuch a poſſibility, then St. <hi>Paul</hi> inſtead of encouraging his <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> the more boldly and chearfully to encounter with temptations, from this Conſideration, that they have ſuch Aſſiſtances both natural and divine, as cannot fail to make their warfare ſucceſsful, might have told them in ſhort, that they were now arrived to an impeccable Eſtate, and that they need not trouble their heads any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with any idle apprehenſions of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93763:137"/> the <hi>Devil,</hi> or miſtruſts of themſelves; with any ſcruples of Conſcience from within, or any fears of Danger from without; for that they were now arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at a degree of Perfection, ſo high, and yet ſo ſteady, that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to fall away, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sin any more: and by this means he might have ſaved himſelf, and them the needleſs trouble of a long Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, when he tells them, that no Temptation hath befaln them, but ſuch as is common unto Men, it is as good as to ſay, that all men who are not perfectly forſaken by God, and hardened into a final impenitence for their former Sins, though they are not aſſiſted with thoſe extraordinary influences of the divine Spirit, which are peculiar to the Chriſtian world, yet they have ſtill ſuch helps both natural and divine, as are at leaſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſubdue any Temptation that can be offered; and if they had not, they could not be ſaid ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be aſſaulted by a Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as compelled by neceſſity and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable fate.</p>
            <pb n="203" facs="tcp:93763:137"/>
            <p>But to what purpoſe does our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Lord</hi> command his <hi>Diſciples</hi> and conſequently us, <hi>to Watch and Pray, that we enter not into Temptation,</hi> when if the Doctrine of <hi>Calvin</hi> and his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows be true, that all humane actions are neceſſary and fatal, and that they are predeſtinated from all Eternity to determine themſelves to ſuch and ſuch Objects, after ſuch or ſuch a manner, in ſuch and ſuch periods of time? then it ſignifies no more to <hi>Watch and Pray,</hi> than to whiſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wind, out of hopes to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it into another Quarter. We may as well <hi>ſleep on and take our reſt,</hi> for any good we are like to do by <hi>Watching:</hi> For at this rate all our <hi>Watching</hi> will be ineffectual, all our <hi>Prayers</hi> to no end or purpoſe, and all our Religion will be vain; for the fatal Knots can neither be unti'd nor cut in ſunder: And whatever has been reſolved in the utmoſt receſſes of Eternity muſt come to paſs in the predeſtinated intervals of time, ſo that the beſt way for us when all is done, will be to ſit down paſſively conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under every thing that can befal

            <p>For how can God with Juſtice blame us, for ſtooping to thoſe Laws of Fate, which cannot poſſibly be reſiſted by us, and by which he himſelf is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, For <hi>Eadem Neceſſitas deos irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocabilis divina pariter atque humana curſus rehit, alligat, ille ipſe omnium con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor ac rector, ſiripſit quidem fata ſed ſequitur, ſemel paret ſemper juſſit:</hi> ſaid <hi>Seneca</hi> according to the opinion of the <hi>Stoick;</hi> and I ſhall prove immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> would be bound to defend the ſame opinion, if it were capable, as it is not, of being defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>It is a prodigious thing that an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, not only ſo contrary to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93763:139"/> and to truth, but to the uſual Sentiments of thoſe very men that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, ſhould ever find ſo much Countenance or protection among us. For ſhow me but one man, the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Pedeſtinarian of them all, who does not by moſt of the actions of his Life, ſuppoſe and aſſert that freedom, which in a fit of diſputing he denies, and I will yield the Cauſe: all his Prayers do either return into his own Boſome; that is, they ſignifie juſt nothing at all, or elſe they flie in his Face, and upbraid him with not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory to God, by an humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and a right uſe of that Freedom, which thoſe very Prayers do naturally ſuppoſe. For to what purpoſe do we pray, if all things are ſo unalterably predetermin'd, that they cannot be reverſed? and if it be ſo that nothing can prevail with God, to alter or to ſuſpend his decrees? or why in truth ſhould he be moved, more by our Prayers, than by our Curſes? by the ſupplications of thoſe who call themſelves the Sanctifi'd and the Godly party, than by the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Execrations of thoſe who
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93763:140"/> are not leſs wrongfully ſtiled, the wicked and unregenerate part of the world, when both of them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to us are equally Neceſſary, and it is impoſſible for thoſe that do theſe things, to do otherwiſe than they do? or is not this to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie and ridicuel, if not perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Life, when at this rate the worſt actions which we can commit are very excuſeable things, and our Duties are ſo far from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any rational expectation of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at the hands of God, that they are rather ſo many pregnant Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Frailty and infirmity of our Natures, overborn by the ſtrength and power of thoſe eternal Decrees, which it is impoſſible to Conquer, and againſt which without their own help we cannot ſtrive? But tell us that Prayers, Almes-giving, Good works, a good Converſation and the like, are means ſome way or other conducing by the divine appointment to the happineſs of men; to the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe bleſſings for which, and to the averting thoſe Judgments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which we pray, that he that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93763:140"/> has predeſtin'd the end, has alſo prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd the means; he that has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd from all Eternity to be pleaſed with ſuch a ſet number or company of Men, has alſo appointed that they ſhall pleaſe him, by his acceptance, or his taking in good part ſuch or ſuch Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he has before hand determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned they ſhall do; or by his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of certain habits and diſpoſitions of Mind, which he has always reſolv'd ſhall be ireſiſtibly infus'd into them: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> of all which is, That they ſhall be happy without any reaſon at all, if Men can be happy that never were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ood; or if Men can be good, whoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctions are governed not by choice, but by neceſſity and reſiſtleſs fate.</p>
            <p>But let us admit that he does prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the means, as well as he does the end, which it cannot be avoided, but he muſt do in that Hypotheſis which makes all things neceſſary, what is the natural conſequence of this, but that when by the ſame eternal Decrees he reprobates ſo unequal a proportion of Mankind: he does alſo by the ſame act of his Will, neceſſitate them to the Commiſſion of ſuch Actions, which he
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93763:141"/> has reſolved beforehand, though they be neceſſary, ſhall be diſpleaſing to him, and for which, as if they had been vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, he has decreed to condemn them to everlaſting Torments, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for no reaſon at all, but what is founded in his own Arbitrary will and power, there being no manner of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Connexion betwixt neceſſity and puniſhment, or reward.</p>
            <p>But is it not a moſt aſtoniſhingly ſtrange and ſurprizing thing, that Men ſhould be ſo obſtinate againſt their own ſenſe and experience, and that they ſhould perpetually deny what they can never help thinking to be true What is it for which we ſo much decry the Papiſts for aſſerting their bold and contradictious Doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation? Is it not for this reaſon that their opinion includes in it ſo flat a repugnancy to their own ſenſes? That it is ſo full of abſurdities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, that let them pretend what they pleaſe, they can never heartily believe it themſelves: Neither can any Man indeed be ſaid properly to believe ſuch Propoſitions as have no ground of credibility in them, but on the contrary
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:93763:141"/> are big with Arguments againſt the belief of themſelves.</p>
            <p>And is not this reaſon every whit as good againſt thoſe, who ſubject all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions to an unalterable fate? For every Man, let him ſay what he pleaſes in a fit of Diſputation, yet he does naturally ſeem to himſelf to be free and unreſtrain'd in moſt of the actions of his life; neither can there be any better Argument of that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which he denies, than that he finds himſelf indu'd with a power of affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming or denying ſo contrary to the natural ſentiments of his own mind and underſtanding. One Man he looks upon himſelf to be wiſe, another juſt, a third merciful and good, a fourth he is temperate, chaſt, and ſober; and upon account of theſe ſeveral Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they all put a proportionable value upon themſelves, and do at the ſame time deſpiſe or hate their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, if they find them deſtitute of the ſame virtuous diſpoſitions and qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Mind; and all this they do upon a ſuppoſition of freedom, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſity makes all things equal, &amp; they would have no reaſon to pride
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93763:142"/> themſelves in doing what they could not avoid. It would be the greateſt nonſenſe in the world, when Fate and Mechaniſm are perfect Strangers either to praiſe or to diſgrace, for any Man to value himſelf, or to deſpiſe and much more hate another. And as Pride without a ſuppoſition of Liberty is a moſt ridiculous Paſſion, a Paſſion that deſerves more contempt than it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon others; ſo is Anger too, unleſs we admit a liberty in that thing or perſon, which is the object of our anger, whereby it might have behav'd it ſelf otherwiſe than it has; but to be angry with things that are acted by neceſſity, is the anger of Dogs that bark at the Moon, it is what <hi>Solomon</hi> calls the <hi>Anger of Fools;</hi> and ſuch may be angry, if they pleaſe, with the Wind for blowing too rudely in their faces; or with the Duſt, for annoying them in a Summer's day.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is a Man's unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to commit a grievous fault, or rather, according to this Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, to be fallen into a grievous mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, for which ſome are angry, others are ſorry, and ſome endeavour
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93763:142"/> to make him better for the future, by giving him good and wholſom advice, and by ſhewing him the folly or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of what is paſt; and theſe laſt no queſtion look upon themſelves as very friendly and charitable Men, which it is manifeſt they cannot do but upon ſuppoſition, that they might have done otherwiſe if they had pleaſed; for Fate admits of no ſuch thing as Charity, Friendſhip, Wiſdom, or Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; but it is the ſame neceſſity, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commendable nor blame-worthy in any, which diſplays it ſelf by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent effects in them all, which makes one of them commit ſuch an action, another cenſure, a third pity it, and a fourth apply himſelf to remedy the like inconvenience for the future, by his fruitleſs advice and counſel, which can never hope to ſtand in competition with the unalterable decrees of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Sometimes again you ſhall have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons promiſe or intend to meet together at ſuch a place, upon ſuch a day, for ſuch or ſuch an end; and this they do, ſuppoſing themſelves to be free, and indu'd with an ability of being as good as their word; and it is a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93763:143"/> ſhrewd ſign that what they ſuppoſed was true, when at a Club, a Coffeehouſe, a publick Feaſt, a Rendezvous, or an Exchange, you ſhall find them all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly met together, which if the fatal Hypotheſis were true, it ſeems utterly impoſſible for them to be; but moſt of them by that particular neceſſity by which they are governed, would either be kept at home, or carry'd violently ſome other way, to which they were predetermin'd before this aſſignation was made.</p>
            <p>To conclude, we have had very warm and fierce Contentions about things neceſſary, and things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and about the Civil Magiſtrates power as to the latter in Religious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which if the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Doctrine be true, is a very needleſs Controverſie; for according to them, if they will ſtand to their own Principles, there is nothing indifferent either in Sacred matters or in Civil, but all things are neceſſary, becauſe unavoidably deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: And ſo the Controverſie is happily at an end, and we ſhould be much to blame for cenſuring ſuch inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent people for ſuch unavoidable Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93763:143"/> but that we cannot help it, which, if this Hypotheſis be true, is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reaſon and excuſe of all our actions.</p>
            <p>And thus, I think, I have proved that the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation it ſelf, how abſurd or contradictious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may ſeem, yet it is not more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the common ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Mankind, and with the plain acknowledgments of its own Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, with reaſon, experience, and with common ſenſe, than this of the <hi>Stoical</hi> or <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> fate, which moſt of the actions of our lives, and moſt, if not all the Paſſions which we find within our ſelves, are combined in a ſtrict confederacy to overthrow, it being directly contrary to the nature of the one, and to the ſuppoſitions upon which the other proceed.</p>
            <p>Another very juſt exception which has been made and managed to very great advantage, by a very Reverend and Learned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> Dean of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury.</hi>
               </note> againſt the abſurd and blaſphemous Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, is this, That it overthrows the whole Fabrick of the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93763:144"/> Chriſtian Religion, by deſtroying that Foundation upon which it ſtands, that is to ſay, its Divine Authority atteſted by thoſe Miracles by which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, becauſe we have no way to judge of Miracles, or to diſtinguiſh them from the ordinary and uſual <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of nature, but by the teſtimony of our ſenſes; which if they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us in their proper objects, when they are placed in the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous circumſtances to make an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Judgment, then it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us in any caſe given to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine when a Miracle is wrought, and when it is not, and conſequently that Religion, whoſe Sanction and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is founded upon Miracles, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be thought to be ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
            <p>And what has been ſaid of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, the very ſame may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Predeſtinarian Doctrine, againſt which, as being founded in the fatal determination of all humane Actions, there is a loud and a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Clamour of common ſenſe and experience. But, beſides this, it is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evident from other conſiderations,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93763:144"/> That if the Doctrine of abſolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation be true, the Scriptures of the New Teſtament are both a very falſe and a very impertinent Book, it being not only plainly contradictory to ſo many plain Texts, of whoſe true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſignification there can be no manner of doubt or queſtion; but to the whole Oeconomy of the Goſpel, to the deſign of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> coming into the world, to the deſign of his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, to the reaſon of his Interceſſion, and Laſtly, to the genius and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Chriſtian Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>John</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 8. God is love. He that loveth not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>knoweth not God, for God is love,</hi> but you know it is a common rule, <hi>deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio ſumitur à parte potiori,</hi> if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of thoſe who are born into this world, there be not above one in a Thouſand who are the Objects of this love and favour, while all the reſt are irreverſibly doom'd to be the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal examples of his utmoſt Vengeance and Diſpleaſure; and all this for no reaſon, but what depends upon his Arbitrary power and will without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Conſideration, then it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:93763:145"/> if a man were to draw a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of God Almighty, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort Mankind to imitate his example, he muſt preach a Doctrine quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, which was taught by the <hi>Diſciple</hi> whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> loved, and who was himſelf ſo full of love to his Brethren; it being more ſuitable to the nature of God, if the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtical</hi> Painters have drawn him right, to ſay, <hi>he that hateth not, knoweth not God, for God is hatred;</hi> the ſame may be ſaid of all thoſe other Pathetical exhortations to the mutual endearment and love of one another, which are to be met with in the ſame Chapter of that good <hi>Diſciple:</hi> Beloved ſaith he, <hi>v. 7. Let us love one another, for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</hi> And again, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11. In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us; <hi>becauſe that God ſent his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son into the world, that we might live through him, herein is love not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our Sins. Beloved if God ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93763:145"/> another.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>v. 19, 20, 21. We love him becauſe he firſt loved us: If a man ſay, I love God, and hate his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is a lar: For he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> And this Commandment have we from him that, <hi>he who loveth God, love his Brother alſo.</hi> It is St. <hi>Paul's</hi> own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, c. 4. v. 31, 32. Let all Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Wrath, and Anger, and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and Evil ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all Malice, and be you kind one to another, tender Hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> So the ſame St. <hi>John</hi> tells us in the third Chapter of his Goſpel, at the <hi>16th.</hi> and <hi>17th.</hi> verſes. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son: That whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life: For God ſent not his Son into the World, to Condemn the World, but that the World through him might be ſaved.</hi> And our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf in his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Sermon on the <hi>Mount,</hi> exhorts his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to mutual Kindneſs and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93763:146"/> Charity for one another, and for their very Enemies, from the example of God, <hi>Matth. 5. v. 44, 45. Love your Enemies, bleſs them that Curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you; that ye may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, for he maketh his Sun to riſe on the Evil, and on the Good, and ſendeth Rain on the juſt, and on the unjuſt:</hi> And then concludes that Chapter with this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule to make God the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal pattern of our Imitation, <hi>v. 48. Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now if the reprobating Doctrine be conſonant to reaſon and to truth, then we muſt invert theſe exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the example of God, and perſwade men to the mutual hatred and deteſtation of one another; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God who is the moſt perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the moſt worthy of our Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>ſo hated the World</hi> that he made the infinitely greateſt part of Mankind, out of a deſign to deſtroy them, not that they had, or that they could ever offend him, being acted
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93763:146"/> by a reſiſtleſs Neceſſity in all they do, but only to reak his everlaſting ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and gratifie the eternal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of his Nature.</p>
            <p>For though it be pretended, and it is very true, that <hi>Adam</hi> acted freely in the Commiſſion of the firſt Offence; yet it is true likewiſe, <hi>Qualis cauſa ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis effectus,</hi> ſuch as the cauſe is, ſuch is the effect; that very offence being an effect and inſtance of his Freedom, it was impoſſible that a free action in him ſhould be the natural and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſe of a neceſſary Nature in us; or indeed that any one action which it was poſſible for him to Commit, eſpecially that for which the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> tells us he made ſome amends by his Repentance, ſhould ſo far al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both his Nature, and ours who are deſcended from him, as that we ſhould be quite another ſort and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Creatures, from what we ſhould have been before: for Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Freedom do, <hi>toto genere diſtare,</hi> Heaven and Earth, Eaſt and Weſt, the Northern and the Southern Poles are not more Diametrically oppoſite, or more remotely diſtant from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <pb n="222" facs="tcp:93763:147"/>
            <p>Since therefore God did at leaſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know, that <hi>Adam</hi> would commit that offence, which was ſo fatal to himſelf and his Poſterity; and ſince upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of that offence, he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordain that all Mankind ſhould be tainted by ſuch an univerſal and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible Corruption, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be effected by any natural means, it is the ſame thing, as if he had ſimply preordained it, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpect to the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> at all, becauſe a ſimple Decree, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree founded upon a condition that will certainly come to paſs, are to all intents and purpoſes the ſame.</p>
            <p>But we need not be ſo nice and ſubtle in bringing our Adverſaries to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, ſince Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf is pleaſed expreſly to acknowledge, that God did not only foreknow the fall of our firſt Parent, but that by a poſitive act of his will he did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely preordain it, as well as all the Miſchiefs and Calamities which are conſequent upon it, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it all to God's arbitrary Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and lawleſs will, which he makes to be the only ſquare and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93763:147"/> of all his actions in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world. Since therefore it is clear according to the <hi>Calviniſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Hypotheſis, that God purſues Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind with ſuch an exquiſite and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal hatred, and ſince he is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the beſt and the nobleſt example of our imitation, how can we better imitate and reſemble him, than by hating one another? by perſecutig and tormenting every man his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? by arming and equipping our ſelves to the mutual Ruin and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of each other? neither is it any argument in this eaſe that ſuch a courſe of life is againſt our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as well as againſt that of thoſe with whom we contend, there being no man who could promiſe himſelf one minutes ſafety, when once he had made himſelf the common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of all Mankind; For if God hate us, how can we better expreſs our i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of him than by hating our ſelves? or how can we better expreſs that hatred than by doing thoſe things which tend to our Deſtruction?</p>
            <p>And though it be true, <hi>that a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhall be ſaved,</hi> that is, as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93763:148"/> do very impiouſly, and very unreaſonably interpret thoſe words, that a very ſmall and inconſiderable party ſhall be culled out of the groſs of Mankind, to be the Objects of the divine Favour, while the reſt are for no reaſon, but his arbitrary pleaſure, Condemned to everlaſting Torments: yet <hi>de non entibus &amp; non appar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ntibus eadem eſt ratio,</hi> it being impoſſible for us to have a real and inward ſenſe of a nother Man's Converſation, or to feel thoſe influences and intercourſes of the divine Spirit which are reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procated with the Spirit of another man, the beſt way of imitating God will be, without any reſpect or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Perſons to proclaim an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen War againſt all Mankind, leſt by a too ſollicitous pity for the Elect, who by the worſt that can happen, will but be diſpatched to a better place, we ſpare the Reprobate whom God hath forſaken, and who to gain quarter will be ſure to make large pretences to the Seal of the Spirit, whether they have received it or no.</p>
            <p>And is not this a precious way of imitating God, which yet is the moſt
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93763:148"/> proper inference that can be made from that topick, if the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> reprobation be to be admitted? are theſe the words of Peace? the Laws and Ordinances of the Prince of Peace? the Doctrine of the Meek and Humble <hi>Jeſus?</hi> or is it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a perfect Burleſque, and Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſong to the Bible? an Infamous Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil, and a moſt ſcandalous Lampoon upon the Goſpel?</p>
            <p>Was it for this that <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Type and the Progenitour of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> was called the promiſed and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeed, the happy Man from whoſe auſpicious Loyns, that Bright, that Glorious, that Majeſtick Babe was in the fulneſs of time to be deſcended; in whom all the Families of the Earth were to be bleſſed? For this that as the watchful Shepheards were guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ſleeping Flocks, <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord ſhone round about them, and they were ſore afraid:</hi> when the bleſt Spirit Cloth'd with a gentle and refreſhing Light, uttered theſe words of Peace and Comfort to them: <hi>Fear not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for behold, I bring
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93763:149"/> you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all People, for unto you is Born this day in the City of David, a Saviour which is Chriſt the Lord?</hi> For this the Beautiful and immortal Quire, that ſing perpetually before the Throne of God, fill'd Heaven and Earth with their triumphant Song: <hi>Glory be to God on High, on Earth Peace, and good will towards Men?</hi> For this old <hi>Simeon</hi> hugg'd the mighty Infant, and welcom'd his approaching Fate with Notes more Charming than the dying <hi>Swan,</hi> or <hi>Nightingals</hi> contending for the Maſtery, with the moſt delicate and tender touches of the fainting ſtring: <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant depart in peace according to thy word, for mine Eyes have ſeen thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which thou haſt prepared before the face of all people; A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of thy people Iſrael?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was it for this the bleſſed and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate <hi>Virgin,</hi> the Royal conſort of the Eternal Spirit, the happy Mother of the Son of God, broke out into that thankful Rhapſodie of Joy and gladneſs. <hi>My Soul doth magnify the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:93763:149"/> Lord, and my Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour, for he hath regarded the low Eſtate of his Handmaiden; for behold from henceforth all Generations ſhall call me Bleſſed,</hi> and more to the ſame or like effect.</p>
            <p>But to what purpoſe is all this joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, this triumphant Noiſe? this ſound of Peace, and Happineſs, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? what reaſon have all the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of the world to call the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mother</hi> Bleſſed? how did the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> bring good tidings of great Joy, which were to be to all People? <hi>how was he a light to lighten the Gentiles? and how a Glory to his people Iſrael?</hi> or is he not rather a Reproach to that Stock, from which he is deſcended, when he came into the World, <hi>not ſo much to ſave, as to deſtroy Mankind?</hi> for if ſo vaſt a proportion of thoſe miſerable Mortals, who are born into this world, are irreverſibly conſigned to everlaſting Torments, without any offence or provocation given on their Parts; and if <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf be that Unmerciful, that Unrelenting <hi>Judge,</hi> who at his ſecond coming the Circuit of the world, is to pronounce that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93763:150"/> cruel Sentence againſt it, and if this ſecond coming cannot be without the intervention of a firſt, then what was his firſt appearance; inſtead of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health and Happineſs to men, but the beginning of our Sorrows, the Introduction to eternal Miſery and Pain, the mournful Prologue to the Tragedy of Hell? and is he not more fitly ſtiled, the Deſtroyer, than the <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the Redeemer of Mankind?</p>
            <p>Again, If it be demanded for what reaſon our ever bleſſed <hi>Lord,</hi> is ſaid to be the <hi>Saviour and Redeemer of the World;</hi> I anſwer, there are three ways eſpecially by which he may be ſaid to have purchaſed to himſelf thoſe Glorious and Magnificent Titles.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In that he came into the world to Redeem us, from the more than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage of Sin, and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Ignorance, by the precedent of his Example, by the light of his Goſpel, and by the Grace of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit working in the Hearts of his true and faithful <hi>Diſciples:</hi> now all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is in vain, of which there can be no Imitation; and there can be no
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:93763:150"/> Imitation where there can be no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour; nor any Endeavour without an inward Principle of Self-activity, and Self-motion; nor any Self-activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without Freedom, they being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but two words for one and the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He redeems us from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by his Satisfaction, or by the merit of that propitiatory Sacrifice which he made of himſelf upon the Croſs, for the Sins of all Mankind; the atonement of which Sacrifice is apply'd to all, who by a lively Faith, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance, and hearty endeavour to pleaſe God by obeying his Command<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments, fulfill thoſe Conditions by virtue of which this application is made; but now where there is no Sin, there needs no ſatisfaction, and where there is no Liberty there can be no Sin: St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>That where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion:</hi> And the 1 St. <hi>Joh. c.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>That whoſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth Sin, tranſgreſſeth alſo the Law, for Sin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but every Law does manifeſtly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a freedom in him to whom it
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93763:151"/>

               </gap>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:93763:152"/> is preſcribed, for Laws are given in vain to them that cannot Obey; and where men muſt Obey, whether they will or no, there the promulgation of a Law is needleſs, becauſe our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is not paid to the Law it ſelf; but it is an unavoidable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to that irreſiſtable Grace, by which our non-complyance is rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an impoſſible thing: if then there can be no Law without a ſuppoſition of Liberty, nor any Tranſgreſſion without a Law, then it is manifeſt according to St. <hi>Paul's</hi> own Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that without the ſame liberty, there can be no Tranſgreſſion, which was the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>And indeed how can it ever ſeem a likely matter, that the Blood of the daily morning and evening Sacrifice, of the Sin and the Treſpaſs Offerings, of the Paſſovers, the Peace-Offerings, and the Holocauſts or Burnt Offerings, the Blood of Rams, and Bulls, and Goats, the Blood of Beaſts, and of Birds, ſhould with ſo great coſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, ſuch indefatigable toyl and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſo much addreſs and ceremony be ſtreaming perpetually under the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93763:152"/> 
               <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, as a pompous and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Introduction to that great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which was in the fulneſs of time to anſwer and aboliſh the ſhadows of the legal Adminiſtration, and all this by way of expiation for thoſe who never had offended? Or did the <hi>Jews</hi> undergo all this troubleſome and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Fatigue? Did Chriſt himſelf ſuffer upon the Croſs only for the Sin of our firſt Parent, imputed without any proper guilt of ours to his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? No certainly, God is too juſt to condemn all the World for what they could not avoid; and the Blood of Chriſt was too precious to be ſpilt only for the ſingle Tranſgreſſion of one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Man. How abſurd? How ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous is it to ſay, that he dyed for thoſe Sins which we never committed? Or that he roſe again for that juſtification which, by reaſon of our innocence, we did not need? Or is it not better to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as the Scripture does, that upon account of our own perſonal Guilt, as well as that of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, we <hi>all lay in Darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of Death,</hi> and that we <hi>all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93763:153"/> God;</hi> and that for this reaſon God himſelf took our Fleſh and dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, that he might be to us in the nature of a legal Redeemer, who was always to be of the Kindred of the party to be redeemed? Which cuſtom of the <hi>Jews</hi> God could not any way ſo properly imitate, as by taking our Fleſh and our Nature upon him.</p>
            <p>Neither will the interceſſion of Chriſt, which is the third way of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mankind, according to this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, make any better ſenſe than his ſatisfaction does; for if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe very Writers themſelves, the ſatisfaction of Chriſt is alone avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for all the Elect; and for the Re-Probate, it is in vain to make uſe of any interceſſion: Therefore I ſpeak it not only with a becoming reverence, but ſcarce without trembling, what a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous thing do theſe Men make of the Mediatory Office of Chriſt in Heaven, who ſpends ſo many Ages in a ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, but fruitleſs interceſſion at the right hand of God, either for thoſe that cannot do amiſs, or for thoſe that cannot poſſibly be ſaved. Whereas if we follow the truth it ſelf, rather
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93763:153"/> than the fancies of particular Men, of how great name or authority ſoever, nothing is more plain than the reaſon and the uſefulneſs of his Interceſſion; for Salvation being annext to Faith and Repentance, and a good Life, and the ſatisfaction of Chriſt being apply'd to the perſon of a Believer upon theſe conditions, which conditions are not ſo fully performed by any as they might be, nor equally by all, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt there muſt needs be very many, whoſe performance is ſo weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, that without any breach of that Covenant, which God has entered into with Mankind, he might very juſtly abandon them to eternal Flames, to be tormented for ever with and by the Devil and his Angels, but that the interceſſion of Chriſt extends and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges the benefit of his ſatisfaction, and makes it more operative and avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than otherwiſe it would have been.</p>
            <p>But, beſides the Prophetick Office of Chriſt, under which I include his example and his preaching, and the Prieſtly, to which his Sacrifice and his Interceſſion in virtue of that Sacrifice
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93763:154"/> belong; there is alſo his Kingſhip to be conſidered, one great part of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of which, conſiſts in his ſitting in Judgment at the laſt day, to pronounce the irreverſible ſentence of Death or Life upon all Men; but there can be no Judgment, where there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence made betwixt the Moral good or evil of things: for to judge, is to act with reaſon, and Fate and Morality are inconſiſtent together, which Fate if it were the only principle and ſpring of Action, the Reprobate at the laſt day need not ſtand in juſtification of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from other Topicks, as they are made to do in Scripture, but they need only ſay, that what they had done, they could not avoid; which being a very reaſonable excuſe, and yet not urged where the Pleas of the Wicked are ſet down by our Saviour himſelf, it is a very powerful and convincing Argument, that he will at that day proceed by other meaſures, and that he will not, much leſs did he deſign it from all Eternity, condemn the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Wretch that ever wore the ſhape and title of a Man for any but volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and wilfully committed Sins.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93763:154"/> 
               <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> ſaid <hi>Abraham</hi> to his God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 25. <hi>That be far from thee to do after this manner.</hi> Which Expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Appeal of his to the Divine Juſtice muſt either be acknowledged to be very frivolous, and nothing at all to the purpoſe; or elſe we muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confeſs that Chriſt, when he ſuſtains the perſon and character of a Judge, and a <hi>Judge of all the Earth,</hi> as he will do at the laſt day; he will not proceed by Arbitrary meaſures, which know no diſtinction of Perſons or of Cauſes, but condemn or ſave by unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable methods, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to reaſon or to juſtice, the exerciſe of which is founded upon the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Moral good and evil, all which differences muſt come to nothing, where the liberty of humane Actions is deſtroyed; but he will act with us upon a ſuppoſition of Freedom, for the improvement or abuſe of which, we ſhall reap a proportionable puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or reward.</p>
            <p>And as nothing is or can be more contrary to the whole current of the Scripture than the Doctrine of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93763:155"/> Reprobation; ſo neither is there any thing more deſtructive of that meek, charitable, and humble frame of Mind, which it was the deſign of the Goſpel to eſtabliſh in the World, the natural and immediate tendency of ſuch Doctrines in the minds of inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Men, though, if they conſider all, they have no reaſon to be proud, being to create a Spiritual Pride and overweaning Conceit of themſelves, together with a contempt and hatred of all others whom they call the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and are pleaſed to look upon as the Droſs and Off-ſcouring of the World.</p>
            <p>There neither is nor can be any other opinion, which is ſo naturally fitted to make diſtinctions and parties amongſt Men, or to preſerve thoſe diſtinctions when they are made, for what greater or what wider difference can there poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be thought of, than between the Reprobate and the Elect? Thoſe who are irrecoverably given over to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Torments, and thoſe who are out of all danger of miſcarrying, and paſt the poſſibility of not being as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as God and happineſs themſelves
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:93763:155"/> can make them? Or what greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity or reproach can be caſt upon one Man by another, than for ſome to ſeparate from the reſt, under pretence that they are rejected and forſaken by God? This being, if thoſe that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate would ſpeak their minds, one of the true reaſons of their ſeparation, as it is likewiſe the ſtrongeſt Prop and Pillar by which that uncharitable Schiſm is ſupported; for I reckon that there are ſix accounts eſpecially to be given of the firſt riſe of this abſurd and impious Doctrine of abſolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and of its continuance in the World to this day.</p>
            <p>The firſt of which is, that inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Interpreters, not minding the whole ſcope and drift of the Writings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but looking only to the immediate ſeeming ſenſe of one ſingle Propoſition, and not conſidering that neither ſo well as they ſhould have done, have ſtretched the interpretation of thoſe places beyond their natural extent, wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets himſelf in oppoſition to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Juſtification from the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or to the Judaizing Chriſtians,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93763:156"/> who would have retained that Law either in whole or in part, as thinking that Juſtification could not be had without it; or, laſtly, to any other, who expected Salvation from an exact obſervance of the Duties of natural Religion, or of the Law of Nature: For by the Law in the Writings of St. <hi>Paul</hi> both theſe are promiſcuouſly underſtood, as might be ſhewn from ſeveral places, but that of <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22, 23. is ſufficient: <hi>The Fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, long Suffering, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; againſt ſuch there is no Law:</hi> that is, whether of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And the ſame may very well be the ſenſe of all thoſe places where he ſays, <hi>That the knowledge of Sin is by the Law; and that if it had not been for the Law, he had not known Sin; and that by the works of the Law no Fleſh can be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and that where there is no Law, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any Tranſgreſſion.</hi> All which may very well be underſtood of the Law of Nature, as well as of that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it being equally true of both. Now the reaſons why Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation could not be obtained by the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93763:156"/> works of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were theſe two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That that Law containing the Types and Shadows of things to come, when once their Antitypes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the World, they could be of no longer value or ſignification. And,</p>
            <p>Secondly, That beſides that thoſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Rites and Ceremonies had a reſpect to future events, which events were now exactly fulfilled; they did alſo under them contain a ſhadow of that inward ſincerity and purity of Mind, without which, notwithſtanding all the accuracy of external Obſervations, they could be of no moment or avail with God, who is the ſearcher of Hearts, and delights rather in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a clean and humble Spirit, than in the fat of Rams, or the blood of Bulls and Goats, which could not put away Sin, any otherwiſe than in a Typical way, as they pointed at that great Sacrifice, which was in God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time to be offered up for the Sins of the whole World; neither could they Atone for that uncleanneſs or inſincerity of Mind, with which thoſe Sacrifices themſelves were offer'd
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93763:157"/> up, or thoſe other <hi>Moſaick</hi> Ceremonies performed.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the two reaſons why Juſtification could not be obtained by the works of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but neither was the Law of Nature ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for this purpoſe, not that it was not perfect in it ſelf, for every Law is thus far perfect, That it obliges no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to puniſhment, than it does to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and ſo the ſame Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>That the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law; theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not the Law, are a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which ſhew the work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their Thoughts the mean while accuſing or elſe excuſing one another.</hi> But though the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be perfect in it ſelf, that is, it requires nothing of us but what is truly and intrinſically good: Nay, nothing but what, all things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is moſt for our advantage: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts no more puniſhment than it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Obedience, it Commands no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is naturally impoſſible to be performed, which no Law can be
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93763:157"/> ſuppoſed to do; yet conſidering the many Temptations, and Infirmities to which we are obnoxious, it is morally impoſſible but at ſome time or other, it will ſo come to paſs that what through in inadvertency, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation or Frailty, we ſhall ſtep aſide out of the milky way of Innocence and Truth, into the forbidden paths of Luſt and Errour; and it is certain that no man ever did hitherto, nor will ever hereafter live in perfect Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, except our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf who was created in the utmoſt perfection of the humane Nature, aſſiſted and improved, by a moſt intimate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and union of the Divine.</p>
            <p>So that in this caſe, a Sin being once committed, it is neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our Juſtification, that is, to our being freed from the puniſhment which is conſequent upon it; for the guilt can never be wholly waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, any more than it is poſſible for that never to have been, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſt: I ſay it is neceſſary that this Juſtification be attained, one of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93763:158"/> theſe five ways, for there can no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be thought of.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We may pleaſe our ſelves with a conceit, that the Innocence of our paſt lives may a tone and ſatisfie for the offence committed; but this cannot be, becauſe that Innocence how great ſoever, is no more than what we were obliged to before: ſo that having done no more than our Duty, we have nothing left by way of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogation to make amends for what we have done amiſs, and ſet the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count right again between God and our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We may hope that our Repentance will be available with God, and that he will ſet our Sorrow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Sin, and let the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate for the latter; and it is certain that the very next thing to Innocence is Repentance, and that God will not deſpiſe <hi>a broken and a contrite Heart,</hi> but ſtill it is equally certain, that whereever there is Repentance, there is Guilt, and whereever there is Guilt, the right of puniſhment ſtill remains in him againſt whom the offence is committed, if he have not actually
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93763:158"/> remitted it already, or at leaſt obliged himſelf by promiſe that he will do it.</p>
            <p>But then Thirdly, The third way from which ſome might peradventure promiſe to themſelves to be juſtified or pardoned for their Offences, is by the Obedience of the remaining part of their Life; but this will not do neither, for a reaſon already mentioned, namely; becauſe that Obedience is no more than we are obliged to pay, and ſo has nothing to ſpare by way of Expiation, for all or any of thoſe Tranſgreſſions which we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: and though it be true that this Obedience is a certain ſign that our Repentance is ſincere, which will for that reaſon be ſure to be the more available with God; yet whatever mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or Inducement it may be to his Goodneſs, it lays no ſuch Obligation upon his Juſtice, as that his right to puniſhment will be by this means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. But then if you conſider how great the frailty and infirmity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature is; and how lyable-our very Duties are to a mixture of Guilt and Imperfection by the coldneſs and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93763:159"/> indifference of their Performance; by the want of a due fervour and arden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Mind, and by the wandering of our thoughts and affections towards unſuitable Objects and deſires, in the very midſt of our Devotion, and much more in the uſual courſe of our Lives, that Obedience, how great ſoever it may Comparatively be, when we ſet it in oppoſition to that of other men; yet in it ſelf, it is ſo far from being able to expiate for the Sins and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of our paſt Life, that it will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of its own defects ſtand in great need of another Expiation.</p>
            <p>Wherefore theſe three ways being found ſo inſufficient for the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sinner, for the reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned; the Fourth poſſible. expedient that may be thought of in order to this end, is that of God's free pardoning and remitting of Sin, as an act of meer Goodneſs, without any expiation or ſatisfaction perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by us, either in our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Perſons, or in that of our Proxy: But it ſeemed beſt to his infinite Wiſdom, to make uſe of this fifth and laſt way, that is, to accept of a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93763:159"/> Proxenetical or Vicarious expiation in our ſtead, not that the other way had any Repugnancy in it to any of the Divine Attributes, for it is the undoubted right of all Perſonalities whatſoever to remit thoſe injuries which are done to themſelves, but, as I conceive, eſpecially, for theſe three reaſons, beſides others which may very well be unknown to us, and are only diſcernable to his unſearchable wiſdom,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe as the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, <hi>c. 9. v. 22. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all things are by the Law purged with Blood, and without ſhedding of Blood there is no Remiſſion;</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> therefore, which was alſo more or leſs the caſe of all the Heathen world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed in their Religious rites to appeaſe God's wrath by Sacrifices, and by the ſhedding of Blood, and this by the expreſs Command of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it would have been an excuſe to them not to believe the Goſpel, nor to accept of that pardon and remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it offered; if Juſtification had been propoſed upon any other terms than thoſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſhedding of Blood,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93763:160"/> beſides that without this they would have had no reaſon to forſake the <hi>Moſaick</hi> platform of Divine worſhip, which muſt have continued ſtill in force, ſo long as thoſe ſhadows were not done away by the more perfect Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, By this means God gave the world the ſtrongeſt aſſurance that it could poſſibly receive of his Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, or of his fixt and unalterable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, to perform on his part the Conditions of that new Covenant which he had entered into with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, whoſe ſanction was founded in the Blood of his only Son, it being not only unreaſonable, but impious and highly derogatory to the Honour and Majeſty of God, to ſuppoſe that the Divinity it ſelf ſhould condeſcend to appear in the form and likeneſs of a Servant, ſhould take our Fleſh and our Nature upon him; ſhould ſtoop to thoſe mean Indignities which were offered him by the vileſt of men, and ſhould ſuffer ſuch a ſhameful and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious Death upon the <hi>Croſs</hi> by the hands of Sinners, and in the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Company of two notorious
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:93763:160"/> Malefactors, and all this to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the world.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A third reaſon why this Method was taken, ſeems to me to have been not only that by faith in a crucified God, we might have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aſſurance of the remiſſion of Sins, but alſo that by his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion which were conſequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Crucifixion, we might have the moſt ſenſible Demonſtration that could be given us of the certainty of our own Reſurrection, and of thoſe Eternal Joys that expect us in Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places, there being no way ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to bring life and immortality to light, as for him who firſt made ſo clear and perfect a diſcovery of them, <hi>to riſe himſelf from the Dead, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept:</hi> and if to theſe three, you will add likewiſe a fourth Conſideration, it may be this; that if God had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a gratuitous remiſſion upon the world, that is, for I would not be miſtaken in the uſe of that word, a remiſſion without any ſatisfaction made for Sin, either by our ſelves or our Proxy, it would have argued ſuch
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93763:161"/> an eaſineſs in the Divine nature, in the opinion of many men, that it would rather have proved an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to continue in Sin, than an obligation, as it ought to be in point of Gratitude, to greater ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Holineſs of Converſation, as on the Contrary, if, for this reaſon, without ſhedding of Blood there could be no forgiveneſs: it follows plainly that nothing leſs than the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of God himſelf upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> would ſerve the turn, becauſe nothing ſhort of this could poſſibly be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Expiation and Atonement for the Sins of the whole world; but it would be ſo far from it, that all the Sacrifice that could be offered would fall infinitely ſhort of the value of this, and God might as well pardon us without any Atonement at all, as by that which would be ſo infinitely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate to the guilt of the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties.</p>
            <p>Further, Though it be certain that God could not poſſibly give the world a more ſignal Demonſtration of his love, than by ſending his only begotten, and his entirely beloved Son to die for
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:93763:161"/> it, <hi>for he that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things, Rom.</hi> 8. 32? Yet this will but enhance and aggravate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of our Diſobedience, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo dear a purchaſe paid for our Redemption, we ſhall ſtill notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding continue in an obſtinate and wilful courſe of Sin; for <hi>how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having thus clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, what is meant by Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; namely, the pardon of our Sins, or the remiſſion of that right of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which is devolved upon God by them; and having likewiſe ſeen by what means this Juſtification is to be procured, that it cannot be obtained by any thing in our ſelves, but that it is wholly oweing to the Grace and Mercy of God, in and through the meritorious Death and paſſion of his Son and our <hi>Saviour Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Righteous, <hi>who knew no Sin, neither was guile found in his Mouth; and who by the Sacrifice of himſelf once offered upon the Croſs, made a full, perfect, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93763:162"/> compleat Satisfaction, Propitiation and Redemption for the Sins of all Mankind.</hi> We may now from hence give ſuch a clear and ſolid Expoſition of many places in the writings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which are ſo miſerably abuſed and ſtretched beyond their true extent by the <hi>Calvini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi> Doctors, as to make them for ever hereafter utterly uſeleſs, to that cauſe and party, which without that method which I have uſed, cannot ſo convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly be done by any other way of proceedure.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom. 11. v.</hi> 6. (if we are ſaved) <hi>by Grace then is it no more of Works; otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace: But if it be of Works, then is it no more Grace, otherwiſe Work is no more Work:</hi> and <hi>Gal. 2. 16. Knowing that a man is not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, even we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by the Faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the Law: For by the works of the Law, ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Eph. 2. 4, 5. God who is rich in Mercy for his great love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:93763:162"/> he loved us, even when we were dead in Sins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt, by Grace ye are ſaved:</hi> And again <hi>v. 8, 9. For by Grace are ye ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God; not of works leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which places together with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others of a like purport and ſignification are ſo far ſtrained beyond their true ſence and meaning by <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Interpreters, as if God in the juſtification of a Sinner, had no regard to any previous Conditions of Repentance or good Works; but that he proceeded perfectly by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Goodneſs, and had not the leaſt reſpect to any other Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever, which it is plain does not only deſtroy the neceſſity of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and a good Life, but ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all the exhortations and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to it, which are ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, and ſo pathetically interſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up and down the Scriptures, both of the old and the new Teſtament; and all the arguments or menaces made uſe of, to deter us from ſinful grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications or deſires, not only uſeleſs
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93763:163"/> but ridiculous, and conſequently ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unbecoming the Majeſty of that God, in whoſe name and Authority they are delivered: and St. <hi>Paul</hi> would be very inconſiſtent with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if this opinion were true; when in the <hi>12th</hi> of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, v.</hi> 1, 2. he exhorts them with ſo much paſſion as he does: <hi>I beſeech you Brethren, by the Mercies of God, that ye preſent your Bodies a living Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable Service; and be not conformed to this world, but be ye tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, that acceptable and perfect will of God.</hi> For why ſhould he exhort us to ſo great purity both of Body and Mind, if God Almighty in the work of Juſtification had no manner of regard to thoſe as the Conditions of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? or if indeed we cannot ſo much as endeavour to be transformed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed of our ſelves, by the exerciſe of the natural Faculties and Powers of our own minds, but all muſt be oweing to an irreſiſtible Grace, by which we are carried away, as by
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:93763:163"/> a mighty Torrent, without any the leaſt ability or ſtrength to ſtemme ſo rapid and ſo impetuous a ſtream?</p>
            <p>Whereas if we go a middle way betwixt theſe two extreams, it will be very eaſie to reconcile theſe places of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to themſelves and to one another; to the faculties of men, and the nature of things, and to the reſt of the Evangelical, and Apoſtolical writings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Follow peace with all men,</hi> ſaith the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews, c. 12. v. 14. and holineſs without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> But now if a man ſhould ſay that the true and genuine ſenſe of that place is this, that no man ſhall ſee the Lord, but he that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it, or he that muſt ſee and enjoy him, whether he will or no; this would certainly be looked upon by all men as a moſt abſurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Interpretation, and yet this is no other than the neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Doctrine; if Holineſs be meerly owing to an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible Grace; and if it be not, then nothing can be plainer, than that there is ſomething of Endeavour
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93763:164"/> or ſelf-activity required on our parts.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay then how comes it to paſs that St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us ſo often that we are juſtified only by Faith, and by Grace, and not by works? why this with a very little attention upon what hath been ſaid already will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very plain and eaſie: For it is one thing to ſay that Repentance and good works are neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by way of merit, and another to affirm that they are required as an indiſpenſible Condition without which God will not impute Righteouſneſs, or make application of the paſſion of his Son to the perſon of a Sinner: The firſt of theſe is manifeſtly falſe, becauſe as hath been ſaid already, all we can poſſibly do, is no more than our Duty, and our beſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances are accompanied with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo great imperfections, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of expiating for our groſſer Crimes, they themſelves do ſtand in need of an Atonement. But yet after all it is true, that without Holineſs, and without Repentance no man ſhall ſee the Lord; and it is ſo true that
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:93763:164"/> even in thoſe to whom God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to extend his Mercy at the very inſtant of Death, which we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe to be but very few, yet in theſe there is at leaſt required an hearty ſorrow and contrition for what is paſt out of a due ſenſe of the foul nature of Sin, or of the heinous malignity of Diſobedience and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to ſo good and gracious a God; and there is required alſo ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and devoutly fixt reſolution of living better for the future, if in caſe it ſhall pleaſe God to grant us a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Life, as may be, not an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a motive or inducement to his infinite Goodneſs, which in ſuch caſes as theſe hath great latitude of operation, to accept the will for the deed.</p>
            <p>Neither does it follow in the leaſt, becauſe Repentance and Obedience are required, that therefore we are not juſtified by Grace or by Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for ſince our Repentance and our good works have no manner of merit or Atonement in themſelves, it is certain that that Atonement muſt be wholly oweing to ſomething elſe,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:93763:165"/> and the Scripture tells us plainly what that is, namely to the ſufferings of Chriſt upon the Croſs for our Sins, the merit of which ſufferings is by the Grace and favour of God, without any pretence or title which we have otherwiſe to them, appli'd to every true Believer as the reward of his Faith in him, by whom that expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is wrought: which Faith, though it can never be unaccompani'd with good works, yet it implies in its very nature ſo perfect a reliance upon the merit and ſatisfaction of Chriſt for Juſtification and Redemption, as does at the ſame time amount to an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Renunciation, or an utter diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all kind of claim and title in our ſelves.</p>
            <p>It is almoſt the ſame caſe, as if a Malefactor having committed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy of Death, ſhould yet notwithſtanding in pity to the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of his paſt Life before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of this offence have a Reprieve allowed him, to put him upon a new Tryal, and ſee how he would behave himſelf for the future; and though neither his paſt nor future deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:93763:165"/> be ſo abſolutely blameleſs, as that no advantage can be taken of them; yet ſince he endeavours to make up in his Repentance, what in his obedience is defective; and ſince he plainly acknowledges himſelf a debter to the juſtice of the Law, and repoſeth his only confidence not in his own uprightneſs or ſincerity, but in the goodneſs of his Prince or Judge; he is upon theſe Conſiderations par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, which pardon though without ſuch Conſiderations and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it had not been paſt, yet the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature of a pardon implies a guilt in him to whom it is given, and a right of puniſhment in him that gives it; ſo that notwithſtanding theſe Conditions the offender's Life is mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and entirely an effect of Mercy, becauſe notwithſtanding them he might very juſtly have been Condemned to Die.</p>
            <p>This may be ſufficient to have ſaid concerning the firſt of thoſe ſix ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts which I have promiſed to give of the firſt riſe of the Predeſtinarian Doctrine, that it is grounded upon a miſtaken Interpretation of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:93763:166"/> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which are oppoſed only to thoſe who had too high an opinion of themſelves, or were not ſo ſenſible as they ought to be, of the grace and favour of God towards them, by ſending his Son into the world to be the propitiation for their Sins, and of the neceſſity of that Grace in order to their Juſtification; but were by no means intended to deſtroy the neceſſity of Obedience and a good Life, or to diſcourage our honeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours at Perfection, how ſhort ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be of that mark at which they are directed; but it is rather, on the contrary, a new obligation to watchfulneſs and diligence in all our Converſation, that God has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to apply ſo mercifull and ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual a remedy to thoſe Diſeaſes and Dangers to which either the frailty of our natures, or the perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our wills, aſſiſted by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and crafty inſinuations of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Spirits, do continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us: and I dare confidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to any man, let him be who he will, who is not enſlaved paſt all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of redemption to a Spirit of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93763:166"/> and prejudice for a party, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having patience to attend to the real Merits of a Cauſe, whether I have not very fairly and clearly expounded thoſe places of St. <hi>Paul</hi> which I have produced upon this head, together with all others of a like meaning and ſignification; which it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry accurately to inſert; ſo as that no advantage can be reaped from them to the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The Second Account which I ſhall give of the origine and progreſs of this Opinion, and of its Continuance among us to this Day, ſhall be taken from thoſe Texts in the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> where he deſcribes the <hi>Lucta</hi> or Contention which is to be found more or leſs in every man, for it is not equal in all, between the two principles of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> or between the natural tendencies and deſires of the humane Soul, as it moves from its ſelf, by an inward ſpring or principle of ſelf activity abſtracted from all Intanglement or Encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance from the Body, which are all regulated by the ſober and ſteady de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations of right reaſon without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:93763:167"/> Prejudice, Humour, Intereſt, or Paſſion, and between thoſe deſires which are owing to the union of the intellectual or ſpiritual principle with matter, from whence it comes to paſs that our nobler part is perpetually ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited and frequently overborn by the importunity of ſenſual Pleaſures, by yielding too frequently or too groſly to which, it follows unavoidably that the natural ſtrength and activity of the mind will be by degrees impaired, as Elaſtical Bodies by moyſture loſe their Spring; or as the Bodies of men or other Animals by want of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and too much eaſe are uſed to grow Scorbutick, reſty, and unactive, but on the contrary by conſtant breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, activity and motion, they acquire new ſtrength and arrive to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thletical firmitude and vigour, as it is alſo with the Mind, which is not more impaired by a tame and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly ſubmiſſion to <hi>Animal</hi> and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires, than it is improved and ſtrengthned by a ſtout and reſolute reſiſtance of them.</p>
            <p>In this continual combat between concupiſcence and reaſon, conſiſts that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93763:167"/> ſpiritual Warfare which we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to maintain with the World, the Fleſh, and the <hi>Devil,</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of which Enemies, or in our utmoſt endeavour towards it; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an effect of the natural ſtrength and activity of the Soul ſhaking off the Cloggs and Encumbrances of the ſenſual or lower Life, which is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly governed by groſs and corporeal Impreſſions from without, the nature of Virtue conſiſts; a on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, Vice is nothing elſe but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary yielding to ſo mean impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or it is that decay or infirmity of mind which is the conſequence of ſuch a yielding.</p>
            <p>This Combat is excellently deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Seventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> from the <hi>14th.</hi> verſe, to the end of that Chapter in theſe words. <hi>We know that the Law is Spiritual, but I am car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſold under Sin: For that which I do, I allow not: For what I would that do I not, but what I hate that do I. If then I do that which I would not, I conſent unto the Law that it is good. Now then it is no more I that do it, but Sin that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93763:168"/> dwelleth in me. For I know that in me that is, in my Fleſh, dwelleth no good thing: For to will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not, For the good that I would I do not; but the evil which I would not that I do, now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a Law that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me. For I delight in the Law of God after the inward man: But I ſee another Law in my Members, warring againſt the Law of my mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in my Members. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this Death? I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, So then with my mind I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God, but with the fleſh the Law of Sin.</hi>

               </gap> by which they meant the Plaſtick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the formative and demiurgick power of God, united to a certain ſubtile or Aetherial matter which it makes uſe of as its inſtrument, as well perhaps for the firſt modelling or exemplification of the divine <hi>Ideas;</hi> (which matter is capable of infinite Variety of poſſibe Shapes, Modificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Reſpects) as for the warming, enlivening and ſuſtaining that Univerſe which the divine Power, Wiſdome and Goodneſs have created.</p>

            <pb n="268" facs="tcp:93763:171"/>
            <p>For Firſt, We may conſider the mind of man barely as a ſimple, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material ſubſtance, created after the Image of God, having nothing of compoſition or impurity in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We may conſider it as the recipient or ſubject of ſeveral no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices and <hi>Ideas,</hi> which it conſiders by themſelves and compares together, with a cool and impartial Reaſon not byaſſed by Prejudice, or led aſide by Paſſion, or blinded by Humour, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or Fancy.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, We may conſider it, as united to a Body, and preſiding over <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits, which it ſends up and down that Body on its Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and by them performs the office of a plaſtick Nature, uſiing them as its Inſtruments in the formation of the <hi>Foetus</hi> and aſſimilation of Food, and by which union it is made ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to all the Paſſions and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the lower Life, and is but too often overpowered and carryed away into Captivity by them.</p>
            <p>Further, that this meaning of the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p>Firſt, That this is not any where the notion of the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from whence the Adjective <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap> is derived, but on the contrary it is every where taken for the inward man or the pure, intellectual, and immaterial nature, conſidered as diſtinct from that body to which it is united.

               </gap> or the Soul is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the pure, immaterial Nature in us, as it is diſtinct from that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Body to which it is united; and in whoſe Happineſs or Miſery that of the whole Man is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ingaged, and if <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap> were here taken, as it is in its derivative <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for the ſenſual or animal Life in men, then fleſhly luſts could not be ſaid to war againſt it, becauſe they are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and radicated in this lower na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or in the vital union of a pure and Heavenly Soul, with a groſs, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent, and terreſtrial Body.</p>
            <p>It being clear therefore that the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in has no ſuch uſe or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation any where to be met with in the new-Teſtament Writers; it muſt of neceſſity be, that ſo different an uſe of its derivative <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> muſt be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the uſe of it in ſome other Authour.</p>
            <p>Neither muſt I from hence be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to inſinuate, that there is any thing of turbulency or paſſibility in the nature of God, if that nature be admitted according to the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> to be united to an Emanative or ſube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:93763:172"/> matter, for though this be the conſequence of the union of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul with its Body, that it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the Reaction of the Matter to which it is united; which Reacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is cauſed partly by Impreſſions from without, and partly from inteſtine Commotions and Diſorders from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; yet that ſubtile Matter which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be thus vitally united to the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or plaſtick principle of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, being created by it, and having no motion, but what it receives from it; it cannot reverberate upon its own Cauſe, without which it has neither being nor power, ſo as to create any diſturbance in its nature, beſides that upon ſuppoſition of ſuch a reaction in them both, yet the effect will not be the ſame in a terreſtrial and ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall matter, as ſhall immediately be made appear.</p>
            <p>The Second reaſon why the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of this word may be thought to have been borrowed from the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick</hi> School, is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his uſe of <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap> or mind, which was the ſecond Perſon in the <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Plato;</hi> takes it every where in the ſame ſenſe,

So <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>I ſee another Law in my Members, warring againſt the Law of my mind,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93763:174"/> or Aetherial matter, of which common ſenſe, and every Moments experience would undeniably convince them. And this was the reaſon, why they would not grant the liberty of the humane Will, becauſe Matter and neceſſity are exactly the ſame as I ſhall ſhew more largely by and by, wherefore looking upon the Soul of man, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Epicureans</hi> likewiſe did, to be nothing elſe but a Collection of ſubtile Matter diſpoſed conveniently for the exerciſe of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation and Perception, they could not think it capable of Freedom, which implyes ſome principle diſtinct from matter, and for the ſame reaſon they deny'd the Reſurrection, and the immortality of the Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as life according to the <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean</hi> principles, was nothing but a Collection of ſubtile Matter diſpoſed and modifi'd after a certain manner; ſo Death was nothing elſe but the Diſſolution or Diſſipation of that col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Subſtance: and therefore the Soul after Death muſt of neceſſity ceaſe to be.</p>

            <p>Firſt, That he ſeems to ſpeak in ſuch a manner of the <hi>Spiritual</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, as if it were perpetually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and kept under by the <hi>Carnal,</hi> ſo as it could not poſſibly bring any thing to Effect of it ſelf, nor were in the leaſt wiſe able to reſiſt the perpetual Impulſes of the <hi>Animal,</hi> or Bruitiſh Nature, <hi>I am carnal, ſold under Sin,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Rom. 7. v. 14, 15.

            <p>Firſt, That even in profane Authors there are Expreſſions to be found, which may ſeem at firſt ſight to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a natural Impoſſibility of doing Well; by which notwithſtanding no more than a Moral is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and that not ſo neither, as if it were Morally impoſſible for us to act aright in any one Inſtance; for at that rate a natural Impoſſibility, and a Morral, would be much what the ſame: but it is to be underſtood of the whole Courſe and ordering of our Lives, which for the moſt part are not governed by the Rules of ſound Reaſon and Judgment, but by Corporeal Impreſſions; by ſuddain Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes and Phantaſms from without, and by half conſidered Appearances of things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:93763:177"/> did for that reaſon take our Fleſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he might render thoſe Men inexcuſable who are uſed to lay their Sins upon the infirmity of their Nature; when yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Chriſt who was partaker of the ſame Common Nature with us, did actually perſiſt through the whole courſe of his Life in ſuch a perpetual and ſteady courſe of Innocence, as was not chargeable with the leaſt Sin, or deviation from the Laws of Reaſon, ſo much as in any bad thought or vicious Inclination.</p>
            <p>The laſt Inſtance which I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, for it is not neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many but pertinent Examples ſhall be taken out of <hi>Seneca;</hi> who in his 52d. Epiſtle thus ſpeaks to his <hi>Lucilius: Quid eſt hoc, Lucili, quod nos aliò tendentes aliò trahit, &amp; eò unde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere cupimus impellit? quid collucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur cùm animo noſtro, nec permirtit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis quidquam ſemel velle?

Stultitia, inquis, eſt, cui nihil conſtat, nihil diu placet.</hi> In which words, though the former part of them may ſeem to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:93763:177"/> aſſert that Neceſſity which the <hi>Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> principles purſued into themſelves will unavoidably infer, yet by the Cloſe of them it is plain that he did not attribute that uncertainty or fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he deſcribes in the humour of moſt Men, by which it comes to paſs, that they ſo often change their opinion of things, and their practices which have an immediate dependance upon the preſent opinion, to any Whirlwind of Fate veering about on the ſuddain thorough all points of the Compaſs, but only to Folly and want of Conſideration; and indeed if all Events are owing to ſuch an unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Neceſſity, then the <hi>Stoical Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> who is uſed to value himſelf ſo much upon his Patience, Equabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Magnanimous and Heroick tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſuch like bigg words as the Gentlemen of the <hi>Portico</hi> are wont to ſpeak, would have as little Cauſe to boaſt, as he that could lay no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of pretence to any of thoſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, there being no virtue, nor any Endowment of the mind, how Noble or Excellent ſoever it may ſeem, all whoſe Praiſe and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93763:178"/> is not by a Suppoſition of ſuch an abſolute Neceſſity perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd and overthrown.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, that if the <hi>Stoical</hi> principles be admitted for true, which did not allow of any thing but Matter in the World, that it will unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably follow that all things are ſubject to Neceſſity and Chance, but yet it is every whit as true, that the <hi>Stoicks</hi> did not always own the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their own Doctrine, but rather hearkning to that inward Sence and Feeling which they had of Things; did acknowledge the Government of a Man's Life and Actions to be in his own Power, as is plain among many others by one place of <hi>Seneca</hi> in his <hi>58th.</hi> Epiſtle, which I ſhall here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. <hi>Illud ſimul cogitemus, ſi mundum ipſum, non minus mortalem quàm nos ſumus, providentia periculis eximit, poſſe tamen aliquatenus noſtra quoque providentia longiorem prorogari huic Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſculo moram, ſi Voluptates, quibus pars major perit, potuerimus regere &amp; coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</hi>

            <p>Nay, ſo great and powerful is the force of Truth, that it has ſometimes
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93763:178"/> extorted from them a Confeſſion of an immateriall Nature, from this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that Providence and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cannot with any ſhew of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be aſcribed to meer Matter, and therefore muſt be the Attributes of ſome other ſubſtance, which is diſtinct from it, at leaſt thus much is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently granted by <hi>Seneca</hi> himſelf, who in his <hi>58th.</hi> Epiſtle already cited hath theſe words. <hi>Imbecilli fluidique per in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervalla conſiſtimus: mittamus animum ad illa quae aeterna ſunt.

Immortalia tutore non egent: haec conſervat artifex fragilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem materiae vi ſuâ vincens.</hi> Where it is plain that he ſuppoſes ſome other principle beſides the ſubtle or Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Matter, by which that Matter is ordered and diſpoſed: and this beſides other Paſſages in this Citation which need no Commentary, is the only
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:93763:179"/> poſſible meaning of thoſe words. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent enim cuncta non quia aeterna ſunt ſed quia defenduntur cura regentis,</hi> that is, all things above continue as they are, while Sublunary Bodies are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Change, not becauſe they conſiſt of an Aetheriall Matter, but becauſe that Matter is preſerved in the ſame State of Fluidity and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the care and Providence of a being diſtinct from it. For by <hi>Aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> there is no queſtion, but the Aetherial Matter is to be underſtood, and then all the reſt is plain of it ſelf. So the ſame Authour uſes it in his <hi>Conſolatio and Helviam,</hi> c.

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:93763:181"/> of the true ſignification and meaning of the word <hi>Aeternus.

            <p>Laſtly, This is the ſignification of the word <hi>Aeternitas,</hi> in two other Authors, whoſe words I ſhall now ſet down.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is <hi>Pacatus</hi> in his <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> to <hi>Theodoſius: Gaudent profecto,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Divina perpetuo motu &amp; jugi agitatione ſe vegetat Aeternitas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second is <hi>Mamertinus</hi> in his <hi>Genethliacon</hi> to <hi>Maximian,</hi> who ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe: <hi>Quicquid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortale eſt, neſcit ſtare, ſempiternoque mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu ſe ſervat Aeternitas.</hi> In both which
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:93763:182"/> places by <hi>Aeternitas</hi> is meant the Aetherial Matter, which by perpetual Motion is preſerved in a State of Fluidity, but would otherwiſe cling together, and become as Groſs and Terreſtrial as any thing below; and as <hi>Aeternum</hi> is that which is Aetherial and Volatil, ſo <hi>Diuturnum</hi> is properly that which continues for a long time in ſuch a State, and <hi>Sempiternum</hi> that which always continues in it.</p>
            <p>From all which it may be pretty plain, if that be the ſignification of the word <hi>Aeternus</hi> which I have aſſigned, notwithſtanding that the Philoſophy of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> knew no ſuch thing as an immateriall Subſtance, yet that <hi>Seneca</hi> by the meer Force and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Truth, conſidering with himſelf how abſurd a thing it was to attribute Wiſdome, and Providence to meer Matter; was compelled to ſide with <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> and other <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporealiſts</hi> in the acknowledgment of an immateriall Nature, which was neither Matter nor a Modification of it; it being abſurd to conceive that a Thouſand unthinking <hi>Atomes</hi> can ever be ſo ordered as to produce Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93763:182"/> for this were to produce ſomething out of nothing, in that Senſe which is the moſt abſurd, and Ridiculous to aſſert, if every diſtinct Particle does think by it ſelf, that Thouſands of them joyned after a certain manner together ſhould unite into one common Soul or Principle of Senſation, or that they are any way capable of Communicating their reſpective Vitalities to one another. And that Life, Cogitation and Senſe were not owing to any particular Modification of Matter, though this be all the Life which the <hi>Stoical</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy will allow; he ſeems to me very inclinable to graunt in his <hi>39th.</hi> Epiſtle, where he hath theſe words. <hi>I nunc &amp; animum humanum ex ijſdem quibus divina conſtant ſeminibus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum, moleſte ferre puta tranſitum ac migrationem, cùm Dei natura aſſiduâ &amp; citatiſſimâ commutatione vel delectet ſe vel conſervet,</hi> by which he ſeems to me plainly to allow that the Fluidity of the Aetherial Matter is not eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the Life of God or of Nature, but only more convenient for the Happineſs of it.</p>
            <pb n="292" facs="tcp:93763:183"/>
            <p>But yet for all this in other places (ſo Confounded were the Philoſophers of old Time, betwixt the puzling Conception of an immaterial Being, and the abſurdity of attributing Life and Cogitation to Matter) he treads exactly in the ſteps of his Maſters the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and by <hi>Deus</hi> and <hi>Divina</hi> and ſuch like words, he means no more but the Aetherial Matter, as the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> do, when they ſay ſuch a thing is done <hi>Sub Dio,</hi> as <hi>Lucretius,</hi> when he deſcribes that which is Born into the World, as entring in <hi>Dias luminis auras,</hi> and ſo <hi>Manilius</hi> very often uſes the name of <hi>Deus,</hi> as in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Citations, out of his Fourth Book.</p>

            <p>What hath been ſaid of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> or at leaſt of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who was their avow'd Diſciple, that they did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, conſtrained by the irrefragable Evidence of appearances about them, acknowledge ſuch a thing as Freedom from Neceſſity, in the Actions both of God and Men, and entertain ſome though but ſlender ſuſpicions of an immaterial Nature, in which that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is founded. The ſame is likewiſe true in its Proportion of the <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who though they were of all
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:93763:185"/> others the moſt confident exploders of immaterial Subſtance, yet rather than deny what they perpetually felt within themſelves; they did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there was ſuch a thing as Liberty in the World, though in the Cauſe of that Liberty they were as widely miſtaken, for it follows una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably from the <hi>Epicurean</hi> principles, if there be nothing but Matter in the World, that all events muſt be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Neceſſity and Chance, which when they felt ſo plainly that they were not, there being every Day ſo many in their own Power, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly at their own diſpoſal, they thought it more <hi>Philoſophical</hi> to aſſign a Cauſe which will by no means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it, that is to ſay, the Deflexion of their ſuppoſed <hi>Atomical</hi> lines from the Paralleliſm towards the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſection of one another; a Solution which deſerves Laughter inſtead of Confutation, rather than with perpetual impudence to affront themſelves and deny their own inward Feeling and conſtant Senſe of things</p>
            <p>To Conclude, <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> whom I think I can prove to have been as
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:93763:186"/> groſs a Materialiſt as any of them all, yet does not only grant the liberty of the Will; but ſpeaking of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Difficulty concerning the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of the Divine Preſcience with it, he ſays that we are not to deny the truth of a Propoſition or Notion which we feel, and of which we are intimately conſcious to our ſelves, for the ſake of a Being, whoſe Modes of operation, and ways of ſcientifical Intuition by reaſon of his infirnity we cannot comprehend.</p>
            <p>And I do appeal to any Man in the World, let him be who he will, and of what perſwaſion ſoever, if <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidonius</hi> in a raging fit of the Gout or Stone, ſhould yet out of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected piece of <hi>Stoiciſm</hi> pretend, that all that while he feels no manner of Pain, but that he is perfectly at eaſe, and ſhould not have ſuſpected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be at all diſcompoſed, were it not for the Viſits of his Friends, and the formality of a Nurſe and a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician by his Bed-ſide, that he is liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all this while with unſpeakable Delight to the Tunefull and Melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Muſick of the Spheres, when yet
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:93763:186"/> his Groans and wry Faces do ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confeſs, that he feels no ſuch Harmony within, would not every one ſay that he does not believe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that he has no reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that any one elſe ſhould believe him? And ſhall we not with equal reaſon ſay the ſame of him, who will needs argue and diſpute himſelf into a neceſſary Agent, notwithſtanding he feels himſelf inwardly to be Free? Or how is it poſſible for us ever to look on any Propoſition as True, when the univerſal Seemings and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Mankind, and thoſe not of things without us, but ſuch as, if they be any thing at all, are a part of our very Nature, and are always, moſt intimately preſent with, and in us, ſhall yet notwithſtanding be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as no better than Dreams and Deluſions of a ſickly Mind.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt Anſwer to the firſt Advantage that may be taken from the conſideration of that <hi>Lucta</hi> or Contention which there is between the two Principles of the Fleſh and Spirit, as that Contention is deſcribed by St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="300" facs="tcp:93763:187"/>
            <p>But Secondly, The ſecond Anſwer may be, that if this place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> or any other be to be underſtood, of an abſolute and uncontrollable Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity overruling all actions, and thwarting perpetually all our good Deſires, ſo as without the help of an irreſiſtible Grace, they can never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their effect, this will deſtroy not only the Neceſſity but the nature of Obedience, for Obedience and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion are inconſiſtent together; to Obey is one thing, and to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled is another, not only of a quite different, but of a quite contrary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Since it is ſuppoſed at leaſt from this very place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that there are ſuch good Deſires implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in us by Nature, which yet for all that are everlaſtingly overborn, without being able to attain that end to which they are directed; what is this but to repreſent God as the moſt cruel and arbitrary Being, that can poſſibly be conceived, who does not only plague and torment us in the other World, for no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but his own arbitrary Will and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:93763:187"/> Pleaſure; but to compleat the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe whom he has predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Eternal Flames, and to ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize his utmoſt Vengeance and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt them? He begins the <hi>Tragedy</hi> in this Life, and creates in them a longing after Happineſs and Virtue, only to make them the more exquiſitely Miſerable by an everlaſting Fruſtration?</p>
            <p>Fourthly and Laſtly, St. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the beginning of the next Chapter hath theſe words. <hi>For the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made us free from the law of Sin and Death: For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the Fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, and for Sin condemned Sin in the Fleſh, that the Righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit:</hi> In which words it is plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all poſſible colour of Exception, that we are capable by Nature of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ſort of Obedience to the Laws of God and right reaſon, for whatever is weak, is acknowledged to have a comparative, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:93763:188"/> Strength, and whatever wants to be fulfilled or compleated, is at the ſame time acknowledged to have ſomething of its own: And ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us elſewhere, not that we cannot poſſibly do any good work, or think ſo much as a good thought of our ſelves, by our own natural a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and power, but that <hi>we have all Sinned and come ſhort of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God;</hi> that is, that our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence though it is not nothing, and though it may be ſyncere, yet it is imperfect and ſtands in need upon account of its defects of ſome other Expiation, than what we are able to make; ſo that after all <hi>it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,</hi> though we may do both; <hi>but of God that ſheweth Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſo far from being true, that by reaſon of the Original corruption of our natures, we are carried forth with ſuch an irreſiſtible violence to all manner of Evil, that it needs a perpetual Miracle to hinder the moſt profligate wretches from being worſe than they are, which yet Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:93763:188"/> does expreſly aſſert; and I have ſhewn that by his principles he is bound to do it; that on the contrary it is acknowledged by St. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that there are very ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and tendencies to Goodneſs, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry powerful inclinations and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after Virtue implanted in us by nature, and it is manifeſt by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that all manner of Wickedneſs even in thoſe who are arrived at the utmoſt perfection of degeneracy and Lewdneſs; is at firſt accompanied with a ſenſible regret and pain, that every man in the cool and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced retirement of his thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes it, and finds always in it an harſh and grating Incongruity to the natural grain and byaſs of his mind. <hi>Nemo repente fuit turpiſſimus,</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a great deal of exerciſe and practice, for a man to arrive at ſuch a deſperate pitch of Madneſs and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as to ſin without any reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or pain, without ſome inward bluſhing and ſecret ſhame; without a ſilent Confeſſion of his Guilt, and an earneſt, though fruitleſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable Deſire, that his loſt Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93763:189"/> might be retrived: Every man is naturally deſirous of a good name, and a good name in the common judgment of all Mankind, not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe themſelves who have moſt groſly forfeited their Title to it, is only to be purchaſed by worthy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and virtuous Deeds: and for what thoſe Deeds, and thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are, we have the ſame u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous and univerſal conſent. All men admire and envy the Virtues of thoſe who are better than themſelves; they excuſe their own Follies, by comparing them with thoſe of other men: and they uphold their drooping Spirits, which would otherwiſe be oppreſſed, by the too heavy weight of guilt and ſhame, either by ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance as removes from them the ſight and ſence of their Sin, or by ſuch pleaſant, though uncharitable, ſearching into the more infamous Lives or Actions of their Neighbours, as preſents them with a comparative Innocence in themſelves. There are none ſo hardened, as to make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick profeſſion, and ſhameleſs boaſt of Sin, but downright madmen and fools;
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93763:189"/> and there are many who by a long courſe of Wickedneſs, have ſtifled the convictions of their own minds, who yet are aſhamed to own how bad they are, out of a fear and reverence for the common ſentiments of Mankind, in a word, no man ever had a good opinion of wickedneſs, but he that was hardened in it by his own habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Vices, or by the juſt Judgment of God, or he that was not truly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of what he did or ſaid, in the heat and intemperance of a Debauch, but ſtill as the Debauch goes off, and the man returns to a ſounder ſenſe of things, reaſon by inſenſible degrees recovers ſtrength, and Virtue begins to ſhake her drooping wings, and pick out the ſickly feathers of the mind, till being too often, and too much oppreſt by the ſteams of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence and vain deſire, this Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Lord ſhines every day with a more gloomy and imperfect light, and at length abandons us to perfect Darkneſs, and leaves us to become a prey to thoſe unruly Appetites, whoſe end is temporal and eternal Ruin.</p>
            <p>For beſides the natural congruity
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:93763:190"/> and agreement which there is betwixt all virtuous Actions, and a conſcious reflecting nature, which cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly look back with comfort upon any thing but what is reaſonable and like it ſelf; there are ſuch plain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in point of temporal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and profit, which flow in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and uninterrupted ſtream, from all the inſtances of Virtue and Religion, that it may rather ſeem a Miracle that all Mankind is no better, than that they are no worſe than they are. And from hence it is that Piety and Goodneſs, are by him who is by God himſelf honoured with ſo great a Character as that of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of Princes and of Men, very fitly ſtiled by the name of Wiſdome; as on the contrary all manner of ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative pravity of the mind, and all external naughtineſs of Converſation, is by the ſame Oracle of experience and truth, branded with the ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and reproachful term of Folly: There being no inſtance of Virtue which is not an argument of the trueſt Wiſdom, nor any example of Wickedneſs and Vice, which does not
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:93763:190"/> palpably diſcover the greateſt folly and Madneſs in the world. Shall we think that it needs an irreſiſtible Grace to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a man to be temperate or ſober when the experiments which almoſt every one may have made of himſelf, beſides the ſad examples which every days experience will furniſh him with, in others will tell him, how deſtructive Intemperance is to health? how unfit it renders us for Buſineſs? how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable it makes us of that diſcretion and Prudence, without which our perſons muſt ſink into Contempt: our Eſtates run to decay, our Families be expoſed to inevitable Deſtruction and Ruin? or Laſtly, how it inflames our Paſſions, diſturbs our Reaſon, diſtracts and diſcompoſes our Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and renders the whole man uneaſie to himſelf, and inſupportable to others?</p>
            <p>What better Remedy, or what more mitigating aſſwagement is there in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions or diſappointments then pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience? and how does a carefull and habitual exerciſe of this virtue ſet us in a manner beyond the reach of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and place us up on a Rock which
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:93763:191"/> no Calamity can ſhake? How does it ſmoothen, poliſh and refine our Souls? How does it blunt the edge of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? And how does it improve and heighten that calmneſs and ſerenity of Spirit, in which the true Nature of happineſs conſiſts?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, How nigh of kin is Patience to Humility, which gives us Grace and acceptation both with God and men? Which procures an eaſie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for our faults; excuſes and hides our Imperfections, and ſets an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional brightneſs, and luſtre upon all the valuable Endowments of our minds? How vexatious to our ſelves, how troubleſome to others, and how deſtructive of the Happineſs and quiet of all the world are Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Impatience, and Pride?</p>
            <p>What infinite Charms? What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Pleaſures are there to be found in Charity, Sincerity, Truth, and Juſtice? is it not plain by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that they procure us a laſting reſpect and veneration from others? That they create the moſt certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and ſatisfaction in our ſelves? How do all Mankind endeavour to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:93763:191"/> avoid dependance and ſubjection? And how are they in love with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? And what nobler, or what ſafer exerciſe is there of that Power, than by doing thoſe things which make for the common Intereſt of the world? and procure us the Friendſhip and aſſiſtance of all with whom we have to do? Or of whoſe help we ſhall ever ſtand in need? What weakneſs does Hypocriſie and Diſſimulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray? How bigg is it always with Jealouſie, Suſpicion, and Shame? And how often does it lay open and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſelf by a too anxious fear of being diſcovered, and by a too ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous and artificial proviſion againſt it? How pleaſant? How excellent, and how Godlike a thing is it to have Mercy, and to forgive? How exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely painfull and tormenting is an unſatiable thirſt after Revenge? And is it not more ſafe to pardon a great offence, then by revenging every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle one, to draw perpetual Dangers and Troubles upon our heads? And ſince beſides the outward advantages with which all the inſtances of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue are ſo plentifully Crown'd: there
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:93763:192"/> is alſo ſuch a ſtrange harmony and agreement, between Happineſs and Virtue, implanted by God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Souls of men, that we cannot enjoy the one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but without Virtue the mind is perpetually out of tune, and can make no agreeable Muſick to it ſelf: what Madneſs is it to affront, and abuſe that conſcious Nature in us, in whoſe diſquiet and pain the very nature of Miſery conſiſts, as Happineſs is to be meaſured by its ſatisfaction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment?</p>
            <p>What hath been ſaid of thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are perſonal, and of thoſe which relate to our Converſe with one another: the Firſt of which have a Natural, the Second only an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall or accidentall Obligation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not neceſſary to the being of a Man, that he ſhould be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Society, or that any other Man ſhould exiſt beſides himſelf; the ſame is likewiſe applicable with the ſame evidence of Demonſtration to thoſe Duties which are more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrictly denominated Religious, as being converſant about Divine
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:93763:192"/> Worſhip, and having God for the Scope and Object to which they are Directed, that theſe alſo are Founded upon principles of ſuch undoubted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Reaſon; that as no Man but <hi>the Fool did ever ſay in his Heart there is no God:</hi> ſo it is ſtill an higher degree of Stupidity and Madneſs, to acknowledge and believe that there is ſo Powerful, ſo Good, ſo Gracious, ſo Wiſe, and ſo immenſe a Being, and yet not to pay him that Tribute which he may ſo juſtly challenge of our Praiſe and Thanks, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſubmiſſion of our moſt humble and proſtrate Adorations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, and the Firmament ſheweth his handy work: Day unto Day uttereth Speech, and Night unto Night ſheweth Knowledge. There is no Speech nor Language where their Voice is not heard. Their Crie is gone out through all the Earth, and their Words to the end of the World.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> tells us, <hi>The inviſible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:93763:193"/> made, even his eternal Power and Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impoſſible for a conſiderate Man, either to look into himſelf, or to look abroad into the World, and ſee the admirable Order, Variety, Uſefulneſs and Beauty of thoſe parts of which it Conſiſts, and ſhall at the ſame time reflect, that he does not owe his Being to himſelf; that he cannot look back upon any long pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of time: that he is ſubject to a thouſand Caſualties and Diſeaſes; that he grows every Day more Crazy and Infirm with Age, that by the experience which he may daily make both in Men and other Animals, that they are perpetually lyable and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Death; he may very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conclude that himſelf is by no means exempted from it: that he finds in himſelf every Moment many Frailties and Imperfections which are very inconſiſtent with a Self-origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and Self-exiſtent Being.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, When in the World without him he ſhall conſider that ſo much Harmony and contrivance could not be owing to an agreement, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:93763:193"/> of the inſenſible and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate parts of it between themſelves, they being by their Nature incapable of entering into any ſuch Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he ſhall be convinced, as he will be by a very little attention, that motion does not neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Eſſence or conſtituent <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> of Matter, otherwiſe all Matter would be equally moved, and that it muſt therefore be the effect or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of ſome immaterial Subſtance, which muſt of neceſſity be coexten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to its own Energy and Power, when he ſhall think that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Aire, or Water, or Fire have nothing in themſelves by which they are made capable of continuing in ſuch a State, and ſuch a degree of Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idity, without which notwithſtanding it is manifeſt, the world muſt run into a Chaos, and all the Animals in it be deprived of Health, Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Life, when he ſhall diſcern that any of thoſe fluid Bodies, which I have juſt newly mentioned, if they ſhould overflow their Banks, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs their due Bounds, and exceed that Barrier which is determined
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:93763:194"/> them by Nature, that is, if they were not Govern'd by more ſteady Laws than they are Capable of preſcribing to themſelves, the whole Univerſe muſt needs run into Diſorder and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. When he ſhall Contemplate the regular and wellpois'd Motions of the Heavenly Bodies: the wonderful Structure and accurate Organization of Plants and Animals in this Lower World, the Formation of Mettalls and Minerals in the teeming Womb of the Earth, the Proviſion which is every where made round about us, for the Neceſſities and for the Pleaſures of Life, all which it is Impoſſible it ſhould be oweing, or indeed any part of it, to nothing but meer Matter, which is both a ſimilar and a paſſive thing. He cannot chuſe from all this but lay it down as a propoſition of certain and undoubted Truth, that there is an immaterial, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Nature, infinitely wiſe, powerful and good, by which this Univerſe and every part of it is after a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and hidden manner maintained, Supported, Governed, and Directed, and when he is Convinced of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:93763:194"/> of ſuch a being, he can as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle help paying it his utmoſt Love, Reverence, Praiſe, Thankfulneſs, and Adoration.</p>
            <p>For this is the nature of Power, that it is productive of Fear, of Goodneſs that it excites our Love, of Wiſdom that it fills us with Wonder and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: and therefore where all theſe three are met together, not only in a tranſcendent, but in an infinite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they are in God; it muſt needs be when ever we Conſider it, that it muſt fill our Hearts with Fear and Reverence, and Thankfulneſs towards him, and muſt by Conſequence render him the moſt compleat Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the utmoſt Worſhip and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>For of whoſe Power have we more reaſon to be affraid, when we provoke it by any act of impiety or Injuſtice, than of his who made all things out of nothing, and can immediately by one ſingle act of his will, reduce them into their firſt nothing again? What goodneſs can excite in us a deeper or more affectionate Sence of Love than his, who when he was indued with
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:93763:195"/> ſuch a Power, did notwithſtanding uſe it after a manner ſo infinitely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging to the unſpeakable Benefit and advantage of all his Creatures, and eſpecially of Man to whom all the reſt are or may be ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubſervient and uſeful?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, What VViſdom ought to fill us with greater Admiration, than his whoſe VViſdom as well as Mercy is over all his works, and who in every part of the Creation, and much more in the whole contrivance and contexture of it, preſents us with ſo amazing an <hi>Idea</hi> of his incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible knowledge and skill?</p>
            <p>How is it poſſible for us to be more happy then by employing our thoughts upon the contemplation of ſo much Excellence and Beauty, by calling off our minds from the rough and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing Enjoyments of this Life, and by uniting them, as much as may be, to his pure and peaceable and Eternal Nature? VVhom can we thank ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for all our Enjoyments? Or whom can we rely upon ſo ſafely in all our wants? or of whoſe forgiveneſs have we ſo much need for all our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences?
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:93763:195"/> Or what greater Obligation can there be to all the inſtances of Virtue in our ſelves, or of Juſtice and mutual Goodneſs to one another, then to conſider that he is always preſent to all our thoughts and actions, who has provided with ſo much tenderneſs and Mercy for all the ſenſible Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore that it muſt needs be a very great offence to his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Provocation to his Power, when ever we are either unkind to our ſelves, or go about to annoy and hurt one another.</p>
            <p>This is the great Flaw in Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> his Politicks, who by not taking in the Exiſtence of a God, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of that influence which the belief of it ought in reaſon and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to have upon our Actions, has deſtroy'd the main cement of Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and remov'd the Top ſtone by which the whole Arch of Virtue is preſerv'd. He has by this means ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a fair paſſage for ſecret Sin to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in: Nay, and has made the moſt open and barefaced Villanies very lawful things, if they have but Power ſufficient to Juſtifie and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

            <p>Whereas though it may be, and it is, as I conceive very true, that the only principle of Obligation, is the intereſt or happineſs of that being to which that Obligation is Binding; yet it is equally certain that nothing can be for a Man's intereſt, which is not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to his own health or wellfare, but, whatever that be which makes for the Diſturbance and diſquiet of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as all Acts of Violence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice do, becauſe God Almighty as well in the works of Nature, as in the Adminiſtrations of his Providence has expreſſed ſo tender a regard to the happineſs of Men, that it is not reaſonable to believe he will afford that Licence to his Creatures, which he has denied to himſelf; or that he will ſuffer that Barrier of Juſtice to be no leſs ſafely than wrongfully inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which if it be once perfectly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown, all his other proviſions for the Quiet and Happineſs of the World, will ſignifie juſt nothing at all.</p>
            <p>If therefore there be any who do by Acts of Wickedneſs, and Injuſtice, diſturb and diſcompoſe the order and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:93763:196"/> good Government of Mankind, and if after this they eſcape without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in this Life, that very impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity compared with the Juſtice and the Goodneſs of God, and with the nature of an humane Soul, which being a Cogitant or thinking being, muſt be of an immaterial, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of an immortal and unfading Nature, is a ſufficient argument to perſwade us, that there is another State yet to be expected, wherein they ſhall certainly meet with a juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of their unjuſt Dealing: the Conſideration of which ought to be ſo much more terrible, as an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Puniſhment is infinitely more dreadful than any Temporal Pain.</p>
            <p>If then it be true, that Mankind are a ſort of reaſonable Creatures, as we generally take our ſelves to be, and if all that is meant by a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is ſuch an one as does, or may Act by principles of Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If there be no inſtance of our Duty, which is not very agreeable to Reaſon, which is not therefore our Duty becauſe it is Reaſonable, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes for our Intereſt and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:93763:197"/> Advantage, then it may juſtly ſeem a greater Miracle that Men are ſo bad, then that they are no better than they are, and it is every whit as plain that there is no inſtance of our Duty, which any man who has his VVits about him, may not of himſelf perform.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay then that I make the Grace of God of none Effect, and I ſay God forbid that I ſhould do any ſuch thing; and therefore that we may ſteer our Courſe ſafely between <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> the Hereſie of <hi>Pelagius</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>Calvin</hi> on the other. I think the uſe or neceſſity of Divine Grace, in order to the right Conduct and Government of humane Life, may be reduced under theſe heads that follow.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is no inſtance of our Duty, which may not in ſome ſort and Degree, be performed by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtrength and Abilities of men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a Common Grace diſperſed over all Mankind, which does encourage and aſſiſt the diſpoſitions to Goodneſs wherever they be found, and Acts generally
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:93763:197"/> according to the ſeveral Capacities or fitneſſes of thoſe Objects with which it Converſes, inſtilling its benigne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences more or leſs according as the Subjects upon which it Acts are in a greater or leſſer preparation to receive them.</p>
            <p>This Spirit was the principle of VVarmth and vital Heat to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Maſs, in the beginning of things, this was that which firſt infuſed a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal warmth into the ſluggiſh and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Chaos.</hi> The Spirit of God ſays <hi>Moſes, moved upon the face of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is <hi>Merachepheth,</hi> which the <hi>Rabbins</hi> take to be a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor borrowed from an Hen, brood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon her Eggs or Chickins; and the <hi>Syriack</hi> Metaphraſt produced by <hi>Baſilius</hi> and St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the ſame Spirit in Beings capable of being informed is a Spirit of Knowledge and Inſtruction. <hi>For whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance: but whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away even that he hath. Matth.</hi> 13. 12. That is, the influences of the Spirit are diſpenſed
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:93763:198"/> among Men according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Talents, and their improvement of them, and from him who ſhuts his Eyes wilfully againſt the Voice of his own Conſcience and underſtanding, or who Neglects to Improve and Cultivate thoſe natural Powers which he finds within himſelf, they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly taken away, which was the caſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> in our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s time, as it immediately follows in the ſame place, and this is exactly the Senſe of an excellent paſſage in <hi>Seneca,</hi> Epiſt. 41. <hi>Ita dico, Lucili, ſacer intra nos Spiritus ſedet, malorum bonorumque noſtrorum obſervator &amp; Cuſtos; hic prout anobis tractatus eſt, ità nos ipſe tractat: Bonus vir ſine Deo nemo eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, As there is a common and Univerſal influence of the Spirit of God belonging to all Mankind, ſo is there likewiſe a more peculiar and immediate Emanation of it upon the Church of Chriſt, to which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter was ſent after his Aſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be its perpetual Guide and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector; and which he himſelf has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be with to the very end of the World, not by the preſence of his
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:93763:198"/> Perſon which is in Heaven, but by the Merit of his Paſſion, the intereſt of his Interceſſion, and by the light and Grace of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Though it be true, that there is no inſtance of our Duty, but may in ſome ſort or other be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, by the naked Strength and Ability of our Natures, becauſe they all depend upon principles of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted intereſt and Reaſon, that no Demonſtration in <hi>Mathematicks</hi> can lie more plainly before us, then all the inſtances of our Duty do, to any man that will but keep himſelf in a Cool and conſidering Temper: yet as there is an unqueſtionable Concurrence of Divine Grace, with all our honeſt Endeavours after true Virtue and Goodneſs, ſo it is yet further to be conſidered, that the frailty of our Natures, and the predominancy of thoſe unruly Appetites, which keep their inſeparable Abode in the very make and Conſtitution of our Bodies is ſo great, that without the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Spirit of God, it is for the moſt part Morally impoſſible for us to perform any Duty, with that
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:93763:199"/> entire Reſignation of our Minds and Wills, to the Governance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of unprejudiced Reaſon, which is requiſite to make it acceptable and well pleaſing in the ſight of God; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Prayer, <hi>Rom. 8. 26. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alſo helpeth our Infirmities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us, with groanings which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be uttered.</hi> And St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith <hi>c. 5. 16. The effectual fervent Prayer of a Righteous Man availeth much.</hi> It is therefore Effectual becauſe Fervent, and it cannot well be fervent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Aſſiſtance of that Spirit which is the only Effectual and certainly productive principle of Godly Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Zeal. Such a zeal as no Predominancy of Luſt or Evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence from within, no allurement of any Temptation from without can withdraw from its wiſtly intention and devout proſpect upon that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Object to which it is directed: ſuch a zeal as having burnt up all the tares and cockle of the fleſhly Life, is fruitful in pious and virtuous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:93763:199"/> and effectual for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to their intended Iſſue.</p>
            <p>Now it being very rarely, if ever ſeen, that ſuch extraordinary influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Divine Spirit, are beſtowed upon ſuch as have no manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in their Hearts to Receive them, and have not made ſome ſincere at leaſt, though weak and ineffectual attempts towards the Conqueſt of themſelves: from hence it comes to paſs that the whole Action reſulting from the common Efficiency of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Endeavours aſſiſted by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, may in ſome Senſe be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted wholly to the firſt of theſe Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as being the <hi>Cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> as the Schools love to ſpeak, without which the other would not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted it ſelf, and the whole Action is acceptable to God on our behalf, for the ſake of that part of it which is owing to our ſelves, or for the ſake of thoſe Virtuous diſpoſitions of Mind, to which the influences of Gods holy Spirit, which are always carried forth in Streams of Love and Goodneſs, towards the whole Creation have ſuch an unalterable Congruity that they
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:93763:200"/> will never fail to be inſeparably uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, nither will they ever forſake us till we have firſt deſerted and forſaken our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Beſides that in thoſe good Actions, or thoſe pious Inclinations of ours, in which the Holy Spirit has the greateſt ſhare; there may yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be more of our own, then we are uſually wont, or then we ought with any thing of Arrogance or ſelf Conceit, to attribute to our ſelves, for a man without this Aſſiſtance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make a perfect Conqueſt of his inordinate Appetites and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, would find them ſo unruly and ungovernable, and Springing with ſuch perpetual Fruitfulneſs one out of another, that he would give over the Conflict out of meer Deſpair, and yield himſelf tamely into an utter Vaſſalage and Captivity to them, but when aſſiſted by ſo potent Aydes, this wonderfully Excites the natural Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Vigor of his own Mind, and he Exerts thoſe Faculties and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which God has given him, with more Alacrity and with better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: it being the ſame Caſe, as if
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:93763:200"/> coming to lift a Burthen, which is plainly too heavy and unwieldy for us, we find a ſtrange unwillingneſs ſo much as to attempt it, but when encouraged by the aſſiſtance of another, we then with Chearfulneſs apply our Hands and Shoulders to it, and each man puts forth ſo much ſtrength and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, as is almoſt ſufficient to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the whole difficulty by its ſelf, and this is plainly the meaning of that Phraſe which we Tranſlate, by help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Infirmities. <hi>The Spirit alſo helpeth our Infirmities,</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, it bears a part of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then together with us.</p>
            <p>Neither is it true only of Prayer, to which this Text has a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Relation, <hi>that the Spirit of God helpeth our Infirmities in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it,</hi> but it is the ſame caſe in all other Duties of the Chriſtian Life, that theſe alſo in their utmoſt Beauty and perfection are owing to a Concurrence and Cooperation of the ſame Bleſſed Spirit, as is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe from this, that Prayer is only a means for the better

               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:93763:202"/> attainment of that great End, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and ſteady performance of all other Duties in order to Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>By calling off the mind from Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a more groſs and Earthly Nature, and by engaging our thoughts in a purſuit after, and inſinuating them into a Communion with God: it Creates in us thoſe Calm, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and quiet Diſpoſitions, which put us in the beſt Condition both to know our Duty, and to practiſe it, by a perpetual, but humble im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, before the Foot-ſtool of his Mercy, It calls down thoſe Graces and Influences upon us, whoſe deſign and Buſineſs is to guide us into all Truth, and to encourage us in every good and Virtuous Undertaking, and it is ſtill further to be conſidered, that the performance of our Duty its ſelf, is in the nature of a perpetual Prayer, and carrys along with it a moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful interceſſion on our behalf; and therefore may Expect, and will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Encouragements of Divine Aſſiſtance upon the ſame Account, upon which they are afforded to our very Prayers themſelves.</p>
            <pb n="329" facs="tcp:93763:202"/>
            <p>Another way by which it comes to paſs, that the whole Action of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and good Man, becomes well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, and acceptable to God on his behalf, though in its utmoſt Integrity and perfection it be owing to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Divine Spirit, is from hence, that his mind is not only in ſome degree of preparedneſs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe Bleſſed irradiations from above, but that when he has received them, he affords them a wellcome and ſuitable Entertainment, he Improves and Thrives under the Influences of Grace: he Warmes and Cheriſhes his Virtue by that Heavenly Fire, and makes himſelf every day by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of inward Purity, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cleanneſs, a more agreeable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle for the Holy Ghoſt, and he that does not quench and reſiſt the Influences of the Spirit, by ſlothful Negligence, or willful Sin, he that when it was in his power to obſtruct and hinder it, does on the contrary promote its Operations, and conſpire with it for the Accompliſhment of the ſame Ends and Deſigns, may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly be ſaid to be the Author of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:93763:203"/> thoſe either good Actions, or pious Thoughts, or virtuous Intentions in which he has ſo great a ſhare, and which it was in his power utterly to have Obſtructed: And from hence it is that we are exhorted in Scripture to be <hi>Watchful, and Diligent, and Sober, to be frequent in Prayer, and Holy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,</hi> becauſe theſe are natural means to preſerve us in that temper of Mind, which fits us beſt for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of our Duty, and for the preſerving an uninterrupted Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and Communion with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</p>
            <p>Again, it is to be obſerved, that the Spirit helps the Infirmities of a good Man, not only by Warming his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but by Enlightening his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and ſo far as his Actions or his Inclinations depend only upon this latter Cauſe, they are as properly his own, as if no ſuch illumination had been, the caſe being the ſame, as if in any matter of Difficulty or Moment, in which I am not ſo throughly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my ſelf, I ſhould take the Advice of another more skilful than I am, and if being convinced in my ſelf of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:93763:203"/> the reaſonableneſs of that Courſe which he propounds to me, I ſhall afterwards follow his Advice, yet the Action is nevertheleſs mine for having done it by the direction of another, for ſo ſoon, as what he ſays appears reaſonable to me, and till it does, my underſtanding is not Enlightened, ſo ſoon his underſtanding becomes mine, I am really of the ſame mind, which he is himſelf, and I act upon Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of my own, though I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thoſe Principles from him.</p>
            <p>But after all it muſt be confeſſed, that of our ſelves we are a ſort of frail and imperfect Creatures, and that our beſt Actions, even when they receive the greateſt Advantages from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance, if they are not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in themſelves, yet they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with thoſe that are, that ſo long as we continue here below, we are ſtill in danger of relapſing from our beſt and firmeſt Reſolutions, and that when ever we give any the leaſt imaginable Ground, we are ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to further and leſs avoidable Dangers, that we are never wholly out of the reach of Temptation, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:93763:204"/> that nothing but the alone Merits and Mediation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> can make our Perſons or Actions ſo effectually acceptable and wellpleaſing to God, as is neceſſary in order to our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>What hath been ſaid of all our good Actions, and deſires in this Fourth Conſideration, that in their utmoſt Beauty of Holineſs and Perfection, they are owing to a Concurrence and Cooperation of the Spirit of God, the ſame is much more true in the Fifth place of an habitual courſe of Virtue, through all or any of the parts and Stages of our Lives, that this is under a vaſt degree of moral Impoſſibility, of being ever effected without the ſame Aſſiſtance: If one ſingle inſtance of our Duty be ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be performed as it ought to be; a conſtant perſeverance in the ways of Virtue and Goodneſs muſt of Neceſſity be much more: for by perſeverance nothing elſe is meant but an uninterrupted Series or Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of many of thoſe ſingle Inſtances together, to make a Man's Life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of the ſame Grain and Colour,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:93763:204"/> and to be in all its parts conſiſtent to its ſelf, and to the Beauty of every ſingle Action, to add a Beauty of Uniformity reſulting from them allto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>And this difficulty will appear ſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>greater, if we conſider that we are not only in danger from our ſelves, but from the Temptations of others, and from the malicious Inſinuations of Apoſtate and degenerate Spirits, beſides that our very Virtues them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do border upon Vice, and the beſt Actions which we do, are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon the brink of dangerous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams: how near a Reſemblance hath frugality to Covetouſneſs, Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality to Profuſeneſs, Zeal to Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, Humility to a mean and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Temper, Prudence to Affectation, Patience to Cowardiſe, a Generous contempt of Power and Riches to a Scorbutick Idleneſs and Sloth: and how are Temperance and Sobriety themſelves divided only by a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Line, which is ſuppoſed to have no Latitude in its ſelf, from the oppoſite immoralities of Gluttony and Exceſs? It was but neceſſary therefore
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:93763:205"/> for St. <hi>Paul</hi> to adviſe his <hi>Philippians,</hi> and conſequently us, and all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as he did, <hi>to work out their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Fear and Trembling,</hi> that is, with their utmoſt Care and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, becauſe of thoſe many and great Dangers with which this War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of ours is perpetually attended, to which it is impoſſible any ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al remedy ſhould be applyed, as by keeping a conſtant and ſollicitous Guard upon our ſelves, by examining the reaſonableneſs of all our Actions before we do them, and of all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns before we enter upon them, by entering every Morning into new En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of a virtuous Life, and by calling our ſelves to a ſtrict Account every Night, for the behaviour and management of the day, according to the excellent Diſcipline of the old <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean</hi> School.</p>

            <p>Sixthly, It is very reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that though God Almighty do afford to all, eſpecially thoſe who are in the Communion of the Chriſtian Church, ſufficient Aſſiſtances of his Grace, to mortifie and ſubdue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to perſiſt in a regular and ſteady courſe of Virtue, if they be not wanting to themſelves, and though it be likewiſe true, that the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe Talents which we have already received, is ſtill accompanied with further Aſſiſtances from above; yet in the diſpenſations of Divine Grace, there is alſo ſomewhat which is Arbitrary and founded upon no reaſon but the uncontroulable determination of the will of God: St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in his time that there was <hi>diverſity of Gifts,</hi> though they were all of them owing to the <hi>ſame Spirit,</hi> and it is certain that in that Age, and ſome that Succeeded it, the effuſions of the Holy Ghoſt were more plentiful, and of a more extraordinary Nature then they are now, though that indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:93763:206"/> upon particular Reaſons, and was neceſſary to ſupport the Church in its Infancy againſt the heat and fury of ſo many dreadful Perſecutions; but yet notwithſtanding, why may we not allow ſince God is the ſole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, and for that reaſon the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable diſpencer of his own Grace and Favour, that he does ſometimes by arbitrary Meaſures allot a greater ſhare of it to one man then another, or why may not this be a very allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Interpretation of that place which I have newly produced. <hi>For it is God that worketh in you, both to will, and to do of his good Pleaſure,</hi> that is, that though he afford ſufficient Grace to all, yet he does notwithſtanding make ſome unequal diſtributions of it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, <hi>pro arbitrio,</hi> by Arbitrary and unaccountable Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>Seventhly and Laſtly, As to Faith in Chriſt, and the belief of the Goſpel, if we mean only an Hiſtorical Faith, it may certainly be attained by any conſidering Man, without any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Aſſiſtance of Divine Grace, by conſidering only in a Philoſophical
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:93763:207"/> way the power of God, and his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to produce thoſe effects which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any humane Efficiency or Skill, and by attending to the nature of that Doctrine which Chriſt is ſaid to have Taught, which conduced ſo much to the Benefit and advantage of Mankind, compared with that human or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary Teſtimony, which has been handed down to us through ſo many Centuries of years by Men of unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Credit and Virtue, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had, nor could propound any deſign of temporal advantage to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but on the contrary met with Trouble and Perſecution, and expct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meet with no other for their Pains: I ſay, upon theſe Grounds any reaſonable Man may of himſelf believe that there was ſuch a Perſon as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Born of a pure Virgin, who lived a moſt Holy and Exemplary Life, wrought very many, and very great Miracles and Wonders among Men, who was the Promulger and Preacher, of a moſt wiſe uſeful and Glorious Goſpel to the World, who Died upon the Croſs, to Seal and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that Covenant which he had made
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:93763:207"/> between God and Men, and who after his Crucifixion, aroſe again from the Dead, and aſcended in a Glorious and Triumphant manner into Heaven, having obtained a compleat Victory over Death and Sin, where he ſtill continues performing the Office of an everlaſting Mediator, and making a perpetual Interceſſion for us all. This may be believed barely upon the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of that Hiſtorical Teſtimony which is given to it, but if by Faith we mean a practical and ſaving Belief, of theſe Truths, which by being ſet home upon our hearts, and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſent upon our Minds, ſhall have a laſting, and a powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon our Lives: this as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, cannot be had or hoped for, without the ſpecial influence of the Grace of God, for the ſame Reaſons upon which I have already aſſerted an habitual Goodneſs not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without the aſſiſtance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the ſame Spirit. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Peter</hi> made that Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Matth. 16. 16. Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God,</hi> Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>v. 17. Bleſſed art thou</hi> Simon
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:93763:208"/> Bar-jona: <hi>For Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Not that it was Impoſſible to come to the Knowledge of this in any degree, without aſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revelation: For ſeveral of the <hi>Jews</hi> did from the greatneſs of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and the Wiſdom of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſuſpect and partly believe him to be the Prophet that was to come, by which they meant either the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> or his Forerunner, and the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion who cannot be thought to have received his Information by any ſuch Miraculous way, when he ſaw our <hi>Saviour</hi> giving up the Ghoſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the dreadful Agony of Nature, at the inſtant of his Paſſion ſaid, <hi>of a truth, this was the Son of God.</hi> But ſuch a Belief as <hi>Peter</hi> had of this Truth, that is a practical and deeply rooted Senſe of the Truth of what he ſaid, whereby his heart was changed, and his affections ſubdued, and his whole Man captivated into the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt and his Goſpel, this cannot be revealed by Fleſh and Blood, which is apt to ſuggeſt thoughts, and invite to practices of a quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:93763:208"/> Nature, but it is owing to the Grace of God, and to the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Illuminations, and Influences of the Divine Spirit, working upon thoſe who have experienced the new Birth, and are become Regenerate, and Born again into newneſs of Life, by the adoption of Grace.</p>
            <p>Thus have I endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the operations of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, upon the hearts of Men, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of the Faithful, ſo as neither to make them uſeleſs with <hi>Pelagius,</hi> nor irreſiſtable with <hi>Calvin,</hi> nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible with ſome of our Modern Writers, who are cry'd up by their Adherents for nothing more, then that they underſtand not what they ſay or Write, nor the other, what they Read or hear, and who do on both hands exactly fulfil that witty, and Judicious Character which <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> gives of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers.</p>

                  <hi>WOrks done before the grace of Chriſt, and the inſpiration of his Spirit, are not pleaſant to God; for as much as they ſpring not of faith in Jeſus Chriſt, neither do they make Men meet to receive Grace, or (as the School Authors ſay,) deſerve Grace of Congruity: yea rather, for that they are not done as God hath Willed and Commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>In which laſt recited Article, though more difficulty may ſeem to lie then in the two foregoing, yet upon a more particular ſurvey of it, it will appear that there is nothing which is not very conſiſtent to thoſe principles which I have laid down.</p>
            <p>For Firſt, This Article aſſerts plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that good Works may be done, but
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:93763:212"/> that they are not pleaſant to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Grace of Chriſt, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of his Spirit; foraſmuch as they ſpring not of Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> of which I have already ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Article does not deny, that there is ſuch a thing as Grace of Congruity, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that there may and muſt be, ſome manner of preparation in our ſelves, by which we are made capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, but only that we cannot deſerve this grace of Congruity, and that is very true, for it is ſtill an infinite condeſcention in the Spirit of God, that it will ſtoop to our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and enter into ſo ſtrict a Friendſhip with ſuch polluted Beings, as the beſt of Men of themſelves are found to be.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, When the Article tells us, that before the Reception of this Grace, even our good Works them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have the nature of Sin: it is not ſo to be underſtood, that good Works proceeding out of an honeſt Heart, and a pious Intention are or can be diſpleaſing to God, ſo far forth as they are done to good Purpoſes, and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:93763:212"/> out of good Deſigns, for this would be to make them good and bad at the ſame time; but before the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Grace, they are tainted with much of imperfection in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by their having the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sin may be alſo meant, that before the Reception of this Grace, and without the ſatisfaction of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the tranſgreſſions of our Lives, they are no more available for our Juſtification, than if they had been bad or wicked Works, becauſe no future innocence or virtue can be a proper Attonement or ſatisfaction for the guilt that is paſt; ſo it being no more than we are always oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, it cannot expiate for our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sins.</p>
            <p>Neither is it affirmed as I conceive, in the tenth Article, that we cannot turn or prepare our ſelves at all, or in the leaſt degree, but that Article is rather to be explained by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the thirteenth, that we cannot ſo turn or prepare our ſelves as to deſerve the grace of Congruity, which I have already granted to be True, and I have ſhown the Reaſon
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:93763:213"/> why it is ſo. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom, 8. 7. That the Carnal Mind is at Enmity againſt God,</hi> by which it is imply'd at leaſt, that there is a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Congruity, betwixt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual mind, and the mind of God. And the caſe of the Heathen world in the firſt Chapter of that Epiſtle, who were deſerted by the ſpirit of God, and given over to their own beaſtly Luſts and Affections, to defile themſelves with all manner of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Uncleanneſs, ſhews plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that there is a common Grace or Influence of the Divine Spirit run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through the World, and that it never forſakes us, till we by many acts of willful Sin, have broken, and violated thoſe Congruities to which its preſence is inſeperably united, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greater or leſſer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions in which thoſe Congruities exert themſelves, though ſince no Man by the Aſſiſtances of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grace, did ever live up to the perfection of the law of Nature: I ſhall neither be ſo Uncharitable as to exclude them from all benefit in the Paſſion of Chriſt, nor ſo preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:93763:213"/> as to determine how far the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of that Paſſion may be applicable to them.</p>
            <p>However if it be granted, as it is all the reaſon in the World that it ſhould, what we find contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the twentieth Article, that <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>it is not lawful for the Church it ſelf to Ordain any thing that is contrary to Gods word, neither may it ſo expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another,</hi>
               </q> then it is eaſie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what we are to pronounce of the Doctrines of irreſiſtable Grace, and of abſolute Reprobation; if we will adhere either to the Judgment of right Reaſon, or to the ſentiments of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to maintain either of theſe Doctrines without explaining one Text after ſuch a manner, as to make it flatly contradictory to another, and conſequently to invalidate the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scripture, which if it be not conſiſtent to its ſelf, can be of no force or obligation to us.</p>
            <p>Beſides what hath been already large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented, of the inconſiſtency of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:93763:214"/> theſe Doctrines, with the conſtant te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, deſign, and current of the Scriptures, if in the place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo lately mentioned, where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts us <hi>to work out our Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> it be but granted, as it cannot be avoided but it muſt be, that there is a Power or ability of working ſuppoſed in them, to whom this exhortation is made, otherwiſe it would be a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Exhortation, and if it be affirmed of the very next words, <hi>for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do,</hi> that they are ſo to be underſtood, as if he had ſaid, that we are able to do nothing of our ſelves, but that God does all by an irreſiſtable Grace; then it is manifeſt that theſe two places, though imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Joyned, are yet plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to one another: How is it poſſible then, if we will follow the Counſel of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but we muſt expound this latter ſo as I have done, ſince any other way, they cannot be conſiſtent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And what can be a greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to the Authority of the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:93763:214"/> Scripture, then that in the compaſs of ſo few Lines, which are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately joyned to one another, it ſhould ſo groſly contradict it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But the main inconvenience of the Doctrine of abſolute reprobation is this, that though it ſhould be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be no other than the conſtant tenour and Language of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is all that its hotteſt aſſertours can deſire, yet this inſtead of proving that Doctrine to be true, will but prove the Scriptures upon which it is founded to be of no Force or Authority in the World. For if God Almighty in the diſtribution of Eternal Puniſhment or Happineſs to Men, have no regard to any Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Goodneſs or Juſtice in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as he muſt not have, if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed only by arbitrary Meaſures, and if God may deceive, as I have proved that in ſome caſes he may, and as it is granted to a degree of impiety by the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> themſelves, when they diſtinguiſh ſo boldly betwixt his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and revealed Will, by the one of which he Damns the far greateſt part of Mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the other
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:93763:215"/> exhorts and threatens them, and uſes ſuch other means as if he intended their Happineſs and Salvation, Nay, if we all ſeem to our ſelves to be free, when yet notwithſtanding we are indeed neceſſary Agents, which is a ſtrange and a perpetual deluſion impoſed upon all Mankind: I ſay, if all this be granted, then though we ſhould ſuppoſe the Doctrine of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Reprobation to be the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and onely Language of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet how can we tell notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that there is any Truth in it? Or if we could be ſecured of its Truth, and were as ſure that we are of the number of the Elect, which is a very comfortable aſſurance when there are ſo many that go the other way, yet how can we tell that we ſhall be ſo to Morrow? What Hopes? What Confidence, or Affyance can we put in ſo arbitrary, ſo deceitful, and ſo uncertain a Being?</p>
            <p>Again, when he doomes ſo many to Eternal Flames, and ſo few to the bleſſedneſs of a better State, if this depend only upon his arbitrary Will founded upon no Reaſon, that Will
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:93763:215"/> may alter, for as little reaſon as it was made, or if it be, that there is a greater propenſity in his nature to Cruelty then Mercy, that Cruelty will be better gratified by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all, and the conſideration of it will but ſerve to afford us a very lamentable proſpect of what we are all to expect, ſo true is it, that this Doctrine is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolidly demonſtrable out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it plainly undermines the authority of Scripture, as well as the very nature of Morality and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Much good therefore may it do our Adverſaries, with their new-Friends, the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which how favorable they are to them, we have already ſeen, and if they had been never ſo favourable, yet afterwards when they Confeſs, that even general Councils may Err, and when they refer all to the deciſion of Scripture, as the only ſufficient rule of Chriſtian Faith and Practice, they would by this means perfectly have overthrown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or if the Scripture could be
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:93763:216"/> ſuppoſed to favour ſuch a Doctrine, that very ſuppoſition would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the truth and certainty of the Scriptures; but if the Scripture and the Articles ſhould happen to Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as I ſee no danger that they ever will, In this caſe it muſt be remembred that we have ſubſcribed to thoſe very Articles, no further than they ſhall be found conſonant to the Scripture, and therefore unleſs we have a mind to be forſworn, and Damned into the bargain, we muſt relinquiſh our Articles, rather than our Bibles.</p>
            <p>But all this while I would not be ſo underſtood, as if I thought there never was, or could be ſuch a thing as an irreſiſtable Grace, for this would be in effect to aſſert that the power of God was not ſuperiour to that of a Mortal Man. Beſides that perhaps I have obſerved more Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it up and down the Scriptures, both of the Old Teſtament and the New, then thoſe who have made the greateſt Noiſe and Clamor about it. The Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Fxodus,</hi>

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:93763:217"/> three Thouſand, and five Thouſand, and multitudes were converted to the Chriſtian Faith, and received the Holy Ghoſt upon the hearing of one Sermon, all this was by an irreſiſtible Grace.</p>

            <pb n="360" facs="tcp:93763:218"/>
            <p>To conclude, when <hi>Jeſus</hi> was driven of the Spirit into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> when <hi>Philip</hi> was carried through the Air to <hi>Azotus,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> went bound in Spirit to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and when he aſſayed to go into <hi>Macedonia</hi> but the Spirit ſuffered him not, all theſe were influences of an irreſiſtible Grace, or Power proper to thoſe times, and of which there are no inſtances to be found in theſe.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſo violent were the Parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſms of the Spirit at ſome times upon them, that they were perfectly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and beſides themſelves, ſcarce knowing what they did or ſaid, and by the extream eagerneſs and zeal with which they delivered what they had to ſay; they ſeemed ſo to others oftener than they were. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt, ſeemed to ſome to be full of new Wine, Acts</hi> 2. 13. And though we ſhall allow it to be true, as the Text tells us, that they only mocked when they ſaid this, and it is likely ſome of them did not believe it themſelves, yet this had been but a cold ſort of mockery, had there been no manner of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:93763:218"/> betwixt Men acted by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>and Men that were full of new Wine.</hi> For this reaſon it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> oppoſeth theſe two, <hi>being drunk with Wine, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with the Spirit,</hi> as having ſome kind of proportion and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to each other, <hi>c. 5. v. 18.

Ye Men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, be this known unto you, and harken to my words: For theſe are not Drunk, as ye ſuppoſe, ſeeing it is but the Third hour of the day: but this is that which was ſpoken by the Prophet Joel, and it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days, ſaith God, I will power out of my Spirit upon all Fleſh, and your Sons, and your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall Prophecy, and your young Men

And what elſe, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, is or can be the meaning of that place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, 2 Cor. 5. 13. For whether we be beſide our ſelves it is to God, or whether we be ſober it is for your Cauſe,</hi> then this, that whether we be in the Spirit or out of it, we lay out our whole time and ſtrength for your Edification.

               </gap>, which ſignifies a calm and compoſed temper of Spirit, it muſt here denote that turbulent and unquiet diſpoſition of Mind, which is proper to Men, in fits of Madneſs or Diſtraction. Though ſometimes itis true, that the influences of the Spirit were ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full upon them, that they fell into a perfect Tranſe, having loſt all Motion or ſenſe of any thing about them. In ſuch a tranſport as this, St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw his Apocalyptick Viſions, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets beheld inſenſible Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the lively portraitures of things to come, and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whether in the Body, or out of the Body he could not tell, was wrapt into the third Heaven, and ſaw thoſe Glories which it was neither lawfull nor poſſible to utter.</p>
            <p>To the ſame purpoſe it is what <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſaid with a <hi>loud Voice</hi> to <hi>Paul, Acts 26. 24. Paul thou art beſide thy ſelf, much Learning doth make the Mad.</hi> To which though St. <hi>Paul</hi> do there make anſwer, <hi>v. 25. I am not Mad,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:93763:220"/> moſt noble Feſtus, but ſpeak forth the words of Truth and Soberneſs.</hi> Yet there is no queſtion, but what with that heat of Temper which was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and what with the concern he was in for the juſt Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of himſelf, and his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, What with the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of that Spirit, by which in the defence of both theſe he was acted, he did ſeem by his Mine and Voice, and his unuſual earneſtneſs in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of himſelf, to be ſomewhat Diſtracted and beſides himſelf, which was ſo far from doing any prejudice to the Goſpel, that in the firſt place it freed thoſe that heard it from any ſuſpition of deſign, and in the Second it appeared ſo plain, that the Men were hearty and in earneſt in what they ſaid, and that there was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Spirit going along with them, that though ſome looked upon it as no better than Madneſs, yet with others it had a ſtrange perſwaſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and was no doubt one of the main cauſes of thoſe great Numbers which were uſed at once to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:93763:220"/> to the Faith by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel in thoſe days, upon whom though there uſually fell a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, yet this was not till after they were in ſome meaſure converted by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtles. So we find here in this very place of the <hi>Acts,</hi> though <hi>Feſtus</hi> was not willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that this earneſtneſs of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was any thing better then Madneſs, yet <hi>Agrippa</hi> notwithſtanding his <hi>Jewiſh</hi> prejudices, which were every whit as inveterate as the Heathen, could ſay, <hi>almoſt thou perſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian.</hi> And this no queſtion is the meaning of that phraſe of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Power,</hi> and <hi>with Authority</hi> in oppoſition to the cold way of delivery of the Scribes and Phariſees, that is, Preaching with ſuch a Mine and aſſurance, ſuch a Vigor, ſtrength and earneſtneſs of Voice, geſture and preſſion, as had with ſome a ſtrange perſwaſiveneſs, though there were others who looked upon our <hi>Saviour</hi> to be Diſtracted, or at leaſt would have had it thought ſo, as well as his Apoſtles.</p>
            <pb n="366" facs="tcp:93763:221"/>
            <p>To conclude, under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there wanted not many inſtances of a like Nature, all the Prophets had uſually the Garbe and deportment of Mad and Frantick Perſons; <hi>Saul</hi> being amongſt them, ſtript himſelf ſtark Naked, and lay without his Clothes for an whole Night and a Day together: It is the Character which one gave of the young Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who was ſent by <hi>Eliſha</hi> to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint <hi>Jehu, 2 Kings 9. 11. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came this mad Fellow to thee?</hi> and whoever ſhall read the Stories of <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and his Servant <hi>Gehazi,</hi> will without much difficulty, be induced to believe that the Spirit of Prophecy was uſually attended with a ſort of Madneſs, inſomuch that it was the uſual Opinion both in the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and the Heathen Nations, that there was ſomewhat Sacred and Divine in Frantick Perſons, as it is ſtill among the <hi>Turks</hi> to this day, which was therefore ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſadvantage to the Meſſage of a Prophet, that it rather gave new Authority and Recommendation to it. But ſince theſe extraordinary effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:93763:221"/> of the Holy Spirit are now whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceaſed, together with the reaſon of them, there being no new Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be expected, and there being ſufficient reaſon, eſpecially in theſe parts of the World, to render every man inexcuſable who does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this. What folly is it to talk of irreſiſtible Grace, when the influences of the Spirit are ſo Gentle, that they cannot be diſtinguiſhed from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Mans own Mind? When we can give a reaſonable Account of what we do, and are not ſenſible of any Violence from without, by which our natural Propenſities are forcibly over-ruled? though that there may be ſometimes, and in ſome particular Caſes, ſuch an unaccountable, and perhaps irreſiſtible bent of our Minds, which cannot well be attributed to any other Cauſe then to the ſpirit of God, is a thing which I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but ſince the Apoſtles themſelves were not always in the Spirit, and under the influences of ſuch an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible Grace, what Madneſs is it to affirm it of theſe Times, when there is not the ſame occaſion for it?
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:93763:222"/> or do not Mens Conſciences give the Lie to their Tongues, when they talk of an irreſiſtible Spirit, in thoſe very actions in which they ſeem to themſelves, and others to be the moſt perfectly free and unreſtrained.</p>
            <p>Thus much is ſufficient, if not too much, in anſwer to the firſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which may be taken from the conſideration of that <hi>Lucta</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention which there is betwixt the two principles of the Fleſh and the Spirit.</p>
            <p>The ſecond poſſible advantage which may be made is this, that the Spiritual principle there mentioned, may be pretended to be no part of the humane Nature, but that it is only a ſupernatural influence of Divine Grace from above, <hi>Rom. 8. 9. But ye are not in the Fleſh, but in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if ſo be that the Spirit of God dwell in you,</hi> and verſ. 13, 14. <hi>For if ye live after the Fleſh ye ſhall dye, but if ye through the Spirit, do mortifie the deeds of the Body ye ſhall live, for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to this it may be anſwered.</p>
            <pb n="369" facs="tcp:93763:222"/>
            <p>Firſt, That there are plainly in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man, if we will believe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs affirmation of St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, two diſtinct principles of Action, which he calls the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and the latter of them ſometimes the <hi>inward Man,</hi> which is a ſign that it is a part of our Selves, <hi>c. 7. v. 22. For I delight in the Law of God after the inward Man,</hi> and ſometimes the Mind, v. 23. <hi>But I ſee another Law in my Members, Warring againſt the Law of my Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This Spiritual principle in us, is that which is properly the Image of God, and the reſemblance of his Nature; betwixt which and the Divine Spirit, there is a marvellous Harmony and Agreement; <hi>For as the Carnal Mind is at Enmity with God, Rom.</hi> 8. 7. So betwixt the ſpiritual Mind and him, there is a wonderful Concord and Friendſhip; he Coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and concurs with it, in all its virtuous Endeavours and Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>And the Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirit,</hi> as it is <hi>v. 16. That we are the Children of God.</hi> From whence it comes to paſs, that the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:93763:223"/> that the ſame Effects are attributed to the Spirit of God, and to our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as their Cauſe, becauſe there is a Concurrence of both theſe for their Production; and becauſe the utmoſt perfection of Holineſs is ſcarce at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable in a ſingle Inſtance, while we carry theſe fleſhly Tabernacles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, and much leſs in the whole courſe and tenour of our Lives, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the two advantages, which may be taken from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that ſtrife or contention betwixt the two principles, which is deſcribed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which what Service they are like to do to the Predeſtinarian Cauſe we have already ſeen; but it is now further to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the very ſuppoſition of a Mind or inward Man, or immaterial principle of Action, for all theſe are one; is at the ſame time, an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane Freedom, and a ſhaking off thoſe Clogs and Fetters which the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Fatality would put upon us. For when things come to be examined to the Bottom, it will
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:93763:223"/> be found that an immaterial Nature, and a free Agent are the ſame.</p>
            <p>Extenſion is the common attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of all Subſtance whatſoever, it being impoſſible to have any concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing which is not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: or to have any notion of Place (The School diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Locus</hi> and <hi>Ubi,</hi> being a very idle, unintelligible Diſtinction,) which is not extended by real Parts, and ſuch as are at leaſt by Cogitation ſeparable from one another.</p>
            <p>It being therefore ſo clear, that no Man can poſſibly conceive otherwiſe, but that all Subſtance is extended, it follows in the next place, either that there is but one ſort of Subſtance, or that there are ſeveral ſorts of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion.</p>
            <p>If the firſt be granted, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this will be.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That matter muſt be ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, (for that there is ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as Matter will not come into diſpute.)</p>
            <p>And Secondly, That all Matter hath a power of moving it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what ever is of the eſſence of
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:93763:224"/> Matter, muſt belong in common to all Matter whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And Thirdly, That all Matter may be moved with an equal celerity and degree of Motion, becauſe the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of things are indiviſible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Motion be of the Eſſence of Matter, conſidered barely as ſuch, and be not owing to ſome other principle from without; it muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long equally to all Matter whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the Fourth place, the reaſon why all Matter is not equally moved, muſt be, that it is indued with a power of exerting or ſuſpending its Activity, either <hi>pro ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrio</hi> for no reaſon at all, or by the meaſures of Prudence, for the good of the World.</p>
            <p>But if it be abſurd, ridiculous, and contrary to experience, to attribute ſo much Underſtanding, Will, or Power to every Stick and Clod, to every ſeemingly ſtupid and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Block, if the communication of Motion from one body to another be a manifeſt proof, that thoſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical degrees of Motion are not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:93763:224"/> to either Body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not to Matter in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſidered, then we muſt look ſtill further abroad for ſome other Subſtance, wherein this Power of ſelf-activity ſhall reſide, which Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance becauſe it is not Matter, muſt be immaterial; neither muſt we be content to ſay only that ſelfactivity is an attribute belonging to ſome immaterial Subſtance, but that it flowes immediately from the very eſſence and conſtitution of it; becauſe if you take away this, you will then have nothing left but paſſive or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Extenſion, which is the <hi>Idea</hi> of Matter.</p>
            <p>It is plain then, and will be plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from what I ſhall ſay in an Appendix to theſe Diſcourſes, that there are two ſorts of Subſtance, and by conſequence two ſorts of Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a paſſive, and an active Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the World.</p>
            <p>The Firſt of which has no manner of activity or motion, but what is communicated to it from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
            <p>The Second hath a power of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:93763:225"/> ſelfactivity, or ſelfmotion within its ſelf, which it can impreſs upon the matter about it, and which it can either exert or ſuſpend as it pleaſes, or as it ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>
            <p>For that Being, whatever it is, which cannot ſuſpend its motion is paſſive in it, and conſequently is moved from without, and that which cannot exert it from it ſelf, hath no power of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity from within; but that which can do either of theſe when ever it pleaſes, as it hath been proved, that it can be no other then an immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, ſo it muſt be granted to be a free Agent; and therefore to deny that there is ſuch a thing as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Will, or liberty of Action in Men, is in effect to aſſert, that they are as very Clods, as the Dirt they tread on; and that they are not partakers of an immaterial Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>The Antients were ſo ſenſible of the Truth of what I have here aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that matter implies Neceſſity, and mind ſelf-activity, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence Freedom. That <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>de placitis Philoſophorum</hi> lays it
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:93763:225"/> down as the General ſenſe of the Philoſophers of the earlieſt Times, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That is, <hi>it is impoſſible that matter ſhould be the only principle from whence all things proceed, but we muſt alſo add to this an active, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual principle, which ſhall be the cauſe of Order, Beauty, and diverſity in the matter.</hi> For this reaſon it was that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> who denied the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of any immaterial Principle, ſubjected the Government of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions, to a reſiſtleſs Neceſſity and Fate; but the <hi>Phariſees</hi> who looked upon themſelves, as made up of two diſtinct and contrary Natures, or as conſiſting of an active and a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Principle, an immaterial Soul, whoſe vigour was blunted, and its activity diluted by the intimate union of a material, groſs and earthly Body, did with better reaſon aſſert, that there was a mixture of Freedom and Neceſſity, in humane Life, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Abraham Zacuth</hi> have repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>And that the Soul and Body are

            <p>But it is ſtill further admirable to obſerve, how exactly St. <hi>Paul</hi> jumps in his ſentiments of Things, with the opinion of theſe ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers: For he alſo makes the Fleſh, or the union of the Soul with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be the cauſe of all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate deſires, whereby it is aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though otherwiſe when ſhe is retired within her ſelf, and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled by cool and ſerious Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from this bodily Encumbrance, all her natural tendencies are to Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or which is all one to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of perfect Happineſs and Reſt. It is and muſt always be the nature of every cogitant Being, to be carried forth, with a perpetual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of being Happy, which bleſſed End being only attainable by the meaſures of right Reaſon and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:93763:227"/> it can be nothing but Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Blindneſs, or want of due heed and attention, or Laſtly, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and diſorder of our Paſſions, all which are owing to the matter which we carry about us, and are in their ſeveral degrees, ſo many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches towards an abſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable Neceſſity, which can be the cauſe of any Sin, or folly of which we are at any time guilty.</p>
            <p>So St. <hi>Paul, Rom. 7. 14. The Law is Spiritual, but I am carnal ſold under Sin.</hi> And v. 18. <hi>For I know that in me,</hi> that is, <hi>in my Fleſh dwelleth no good thing.</hi> And v. 20. <hi>Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwelleth in me.</hi> And v. 23. <hi>But I ſee another Law in my Members, warring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to the law of Sin, which is in my Members.</hi> In which and other places already mentioned, and now needleſs to be again repeated, he very truely and wiſely aſſerts the mind or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man to be a principle of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whoſe nature and Buſineſs it is to determine its ſelf according to what
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:93763:227"/> is moſt ſuitable to its true Intereſt, of which when it is not violently carried away by the importunity of paſſion, and ſenſual pleaſure, it is a proper and impartial Judge, but being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to a Body which is the ſeed and ſource of every evil deſire and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, it is by their perpetual ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation diverted from its proper courſe, and impoſed upon by falſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of profit, intereſt or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo as it cannot ſo eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what is for its true advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and before it has ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered of things, proceeds to action, which is ſo far ſinful, as it might have been avoided by care and circumſpection, and ſo far more or leſs an approach to abſolute Neceſſity, as it is more or leſs influenced by the tumult and diſorder of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial or neceſſary principle in us.</p>
            <p>So that in every virtuous action, there is an inſtance given of abſolute and untainted Freedom, becauſe in theſe the Mind conſiders wholly and indifferently of the true worth and value of things, and determines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, with an equal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:93763:228"/> Judgment, and proceeds all the way upon ſteady principles, of Truth and Reaſon: But in all Vice there is a mixture of Freedom and Neceſſity together. Of Neceſſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Sin is owing to the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minance of the neceſſary or material cauſe, and yet of Freedom, becauſe if that predominance cannot poſſibly be overcome, by our utmoſt diligence, or circumſpection or power, this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly deſtroys the nature of Sin, and makes us only paſſive in what we do.</p>
            <p>This is the meaning of thoſe other places already cited, <hi>v. 15. That which I do, I allow not: For what I would, that do I not, but what I hate that do I.</hi> And <hi>v. 19. The good that I would I do not, but the evil which I would not that I do:</hi> That is, the Will of Man properly ſo called, is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of action, ſteared and directed by the Underſtanding, and ſo is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally carried forth to nothing but what is reaſonable and fit to be done; and therefore every wicked, or which is all one, unreaſonable deſire is a violence done to the natural bent and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:93763:228"/> tendency of the humane Will, and is the effect of that union, which there is betwixt the neceſſary principle and the free, by which it comes to paſs that the latter of theſe, if it be not perfectly overcome, yet being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually and ſtrongly ſollicited, it is morally impoſſible for it to keep ſo ſtrictly upon its Guard, as not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be impoſed upon, and ſtill the more it yields, the more weak and infirm it grows, and the leſs able to make any tolerable reſiſtance for the future: Beſides that it cannot be that conſiderations of Virtue ſhould be warm upon our Minds at the ſame time, when temptations of Luſt and Pleaſure from without, have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful influence upon them, for theſe two are inconſiſtent together, and do as the <hi>Logicians</hi> are uſed to ſay by contraries, expell one another out of the ſame Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now then,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, v.</hi> 17, and 20. <hi>It is no more I that do it but Sin that dwelleth in me.</hi> No more I, that is, it is not the pure intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual nature in me, which is truly and properly my ſelf, and which hath
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:93763:229"/> no tendency but to reaſonable Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>but Sin that dwelleth in me,</hi> that is, it is the animal or bruitiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, reſulting from the union of the Soul with Matter, which by perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual importunity and ſollicitation does by degrees overpower the guards of Reaſon, and amounts almoſt to a neceſſity of doing evil.</p>
            <p>But here it is to be taken notice, before we paſs any further, that this Pronoun (<hi>I</hi>) in this Chapter, is uſed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in a threefold accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It ſignifies the whole Perſon, conſiſting both of Soul and Body, of a purely immaterial, and of an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal or fleſhly Nature, <hi>v. 15, 16. For that which I do, I allow not, For what I would that do I not, but what I hate that do I: If then I do that which I allow not, I conſent unto the Law that it is good,</hi> and <hi>v. 19, For the good that I would I do not, but the evil which I would not, that I do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is taken for the pure intellectual and abſtracted Nature, <hi>v.</hi> 20, &amp;c. <hi>Now if I do that I would
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:93763:229"/> not, it is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwelleth in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then Thirdly and Laſtly, It is taken otherwhile only for the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal or fleſhly Life, <hi>v. 18. For I know that in me, that is, in my Fleſh dwelleth no good thing: For to will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwelleth in me,</hi>

               </gap> there is ſomething of involuntary denoted, and that it does very properly ſhadow cut unto us, that mixture of Neceſſity and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which there is to be found in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinful action, and what if <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap> in the <hi>Greek,</hi> ſhould all of them be thought to owe their derivation to the Verb <hi>hamar Ligavit,</hi> or <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulos fecit</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, from whence <hi>homer Manipulus,</hi> which was a Pledge, or Earneſt-penny, or an acknowledgment that the reſt of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:93763:230"/> the harveſt was equally due to him, to whom the <hi>Homer</hi> it ſelf was conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and offered up; but this is a ſmall Criticiſme, and indeed an improbable one into the bargain, which I do not ſtand upon.</p>
            <p>A third cauſe which I ſhall aſſign of the great prevalence and growth of <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Doctrines, is this; that notwithſtanding when matters are examined to the bottom, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of piety and holy living, yet to the careleſs and unthinking view of many of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Diſciples and Adherents, they have an appearance of an extraordinary ſanctity, by vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a man's ſelf at ſuch a prodigious rate, and by magnifying the Grace of God, without which I acknowledge we can do nothing as we ought, to ſo unreaſonable a degree, as includes in it the utter ruin and deſtruction of all the powers and faculties of the mind of man, which nature will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and therefore God does not and cannot poſſibly be ſuppoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <pb n="386" facs="tcp:93763:231"/>
            <p>A fourth reaſon which I believe to have been a motive to Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> to propagate this Doctrine, and I am ſure in the nature of things it was not only a poſſible, but a very probable reaſon, is, that in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> there were ſuch things as Pardons and Indulgences to be had upon occaſion, which gave an Artificial eaſe to the conſciences of men, when the reflection upon the paſt wickedneſs and follies of their life, wou'd either have driven them into perfect deſpair, or at leaſt made them very uneaſy and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to themſelves; and the finding out a cheap expedient, an expedient grounded in the very nature of things, and conſequently ſuch as might be had for nothing, ſuch as was not expoſed to the envy of the <hi>Papal</hi> Indulgencies and Diſpenſations, could not chuſe but be very ſerviceable to the Inventor of it, and muſt needs draw abundance of Fiſhes into his Net: for men do very eaſily excuſe themſelves for what is paſt, when they conſider they could not help it, and then being liſted into ſuch a Party, where all take themſelves
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:93763:231"/> to be of the Elect, added to this other comfortable conſideration, that the Elect cannot poſſibly fall away from Grace; This makes them look not only without remorſe, but with ſatisfaction and pleaſure upon the enormities of their paſt life, they will repeat them and chew them with a Guſto, as I have ſeen many of this ſort of People do, as being the unavoidable conſequences of the beaſtly, and as I may call with a great deal of reaſon, the <hi>unnatural</hi> ſtate of nature. But now they tell you their pardon is ſeal'd, and they are ſure 'tis impoſſible for them to miſcarry, which is Milk and Honey without Money and without Price, a <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation at once more cheap and more effectual then any his <hi>Holineſs</hi> can afford at <hi>Rome,</hi> which was thought for many years to have been the only ſtaple of that profitable Trade; for it is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the cauſe of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> and to the intereſt of a ſeparation that might be juſtifyed upon other grounds; though it be more effectually promoted by this, and though the Pope indeed in point of ready money, have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:93763:232"/> the ſtart of the Doctours of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which brings me to the fifth thing, and that is, that this Doctrine of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection on the one hand, and of abſolute rejection and reprobation on the other, is apt to fill men with inſolence and pride, with an high opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and with a contempt and hatred of others; and ſo is at once a natural cauſe of ſeparation, and of an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and inveterate continuance in it. Whether the grounds of ſuch ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be reaſonable or no, which, as it did confirm and ſtrengthen the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (a thing that was otherwiſe neceſſary to be done without fancying any ſuch eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal decrees to make themſelves proud, and to breed an hatred and contempt of thoſe from whom they ſeparate for juſtifyable reaſons) ſo I reckon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that it is the great Pillar of the Schiſme from our Church at this day, which as it pretends to greater purity, ſo it proceeds upon an opinion that the Separatiſts for it are the Elect of God, while we from being peaceable and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:93763:232"/> honeſt without terms of art, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or being good Subjects without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and for being good Chriſtians without cenſuring all as Reprobates, that differ from us, are ſometimes pityed, and at other times deſpiſed as unregenerate Wretches, being yet in our ſins and in the ſtate of nature, that is, in ſuch a ſtate in which there is no ſalvation, and in which there is no other proſpect but of Eternal death, and <hi>a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Adverſaries.</hi> This, if it be examined, will be found to be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Ear-mark and Characteriſtique of the Separation; and I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that there cannot be a better ſervice done to the Church or to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, then by expoſing ſuch pernicious doctrines, ſo injurious to God, and ſo deſtructive to the peace and quiet of the world, to that diſgrace and infamy which they deſerve.</p>
            <p>But ſixthly and laſtly, the laſt thing which I ſhall mention, as having given occaſion and encouragement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a doctrine, is the overheated
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:93763:233"/> zeal of St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that age againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who though it neither can nor muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, that he was much to blame, that he attributed too much to the Powers of Nature, and too little to the helps and Aſſiſtances of Grace, yet it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually certain that thoſe who oppoſed him both in that age and afterwards, went too far into the other extreme; it muſt likewiſe be acknowledged to the credit of our Country, in which he had his birth, that he was a very wiſe, as well as virtuous perſon, and that for the clearneſs of his reaſon, he had incomparably the advantage of all his adverſaries put together; and upon ſuppoſition that his laſt conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were not extorted from him by the violence of his oppoſers, but by the evidence of truth, and by a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enquiry into the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and into the nature of things, (for our belief of theſe divine aſſiſtances is founded in both:) I ſhould make no very great ſcruple to affirm, that he was a tolerably Orthodox Divine. And thus much ſhall ſuffice to have written upon
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:93763:233"/> this weighty Subject concerning Freedom and Neceſſity, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſeveral bounds, borderings, and interfering mixtures, together with the genuine cauſes and effects of the one and of the other.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:93763:259"/> Soul is which is our Governor and Guide, is every whit as difficult to explain, as where it is; one will tell you it is a certain breath or blaſt, another a certain harmony or proportion, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it is the power or energy of the Divine Subſtance, and a part of it; ſome will have it be nothing elſe but a certain aerial, volatil and ſubtile matter, ſome ſay it is an incorporeal or imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial power, (that is the power or virtue of ſomething which is not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) and others will have it be nothing but the temper of the Blood, or a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of heat which is ſenſible and vital.

            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 167. In the Apologue or para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Narrative of the ſufferings of <hi>Job, &amp;c.</hi> I call it an Apologue or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolical Narrative, becauſe the whole ſtory, as it is laid down in the Book that goes under that name, is not a
<pb facs="tcp:93763:274"/> real thing, but a parable, according to the uſage of Antiquity in the Eaſtern Countries, to inſtruct the world by Parables and Symbols, which was not quite diſuſed in our Saviours time; the thing in ſhort is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> is the character of a perſon emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for his power and wealth, as well as virtue: he loſt the firſt of theſe, and was reduced to very uneaſie cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in his Fortune, and he was likewiſe, as the ſtory repreſents, robbed of his Children, and afflicted with ſore pains and diſeaſes in his Body; all which he ſuffered with an unſhaken conſtancy, and was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt example of truſt and confidence in the goodneſs of God and ſubmiſſion to his will, that either thoſe times or any other have afforded: But it is manifeſt, if we reſpect the truth of things, that to make up the character of a perfect Man in the worſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that poſſibly can befall him, all things are deſcribed in a very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable extremity. I ſay nothing of Satans appearing among the Sons of God, which I have ſpoken to already in the diſcourſe it ſelf; but his Corn and
<pb facs="tcp:93763:274"/> Cattle being all deſtroy'd, his Children kill'd, his Houſes being beaten down by Tempeſts, blowing at the ſame time from all quarters of the Heaven, and all points of the Compaſs; are plain arguments that it is a ſtudied de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Calamity, that ſo the patience of <hi>Job</hi> may appear the more conſpicuous, and the character of the perfect Man more perfect, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, with which <hi>Job</hi> comforts and ſupports himſelf, in the midſt of ſuch extreme circumſtances, are but a repreſentation of the natural remedies which a Wiſe Man and a Philoſopher ought to apply to himſelf, when oppreſt by the iniquity of an adverſe fortune.</p>
            <p>To make the ſcene more Tragical, and to give him an occaſion of inſiſting upon thoſe pious, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical conſiderations, which are the beſt ſupports of a wiſe Man in diſtreſs, his Wife and his Comforters are introduced, and at the end of each calamity there is ſtill one Meſſenger left to come and tell the News, as the conſtruction of the parable did require; becauſe without this, the ſtory could not have been told, and the ſame I
<pb facs="tcp:93763:275"/> preſume, may be ſaid of ſome of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books, particularly thoſe of <hi>Judith</hi> and <hi>Suſanna,</hi> that they are not ſo much the deſcription of real events, as parabolical deſcriptions; the firſt of the power and danger of love and the ſecond of the indecency a grayhair'd luſt. For <hi>Judith</hi> is <hi>Jehudith,</hi> and ſignifies any <hi>Jeweſs</hi> in general, without reſpect to any particular Woman, and <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernes</hi> by an <hi>M.</hi> (a very light and eaſie mutation) is <hi>Alouph Arami,</hi> or <hi>the Aſtyrian Captain,</hi> or <hi>General,</hi> as he is expresſly called by the Writer of that Book, '<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> And for <hi>Suſanna,</hi> it is manifeſt by its Etymology, which is from <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> ſignifying <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> that it may denote any handſome Woman in the world, and laſtly to return to <hi>Job,</hi> from whom we have wandered. What is the ſignification of his name? the <hi>Maſoreth</hi> points it <hi>Ijob,</hi> which is <hi>Vox nihili,</hi> which ſignifies juſt nothing at all, but I make no ſcruple boldly to pronounce, that the true pronunciation is <hi>Ajoub.</hi> For <hi>Ajoub</hi> from <hi>Ajab</hi> is, <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſari, inimicitiâproſequi inimicâ volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. &amp; in affectu aliquem eſſe.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93763:275"/> The Devil in this parable is called <hi>Satan,</hi> which is as much as <hi>Ojeb</hi> in <hi>Pohel,</hi> a very uſual name in Scripture for an enemy, and <hi>Ajoub</hi> in the other participle is he that is the object of this hatred, and thus <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>Ajoub</hi> are <hi>relata;</hi> and this may be ſufficient to ſilence the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie who this <hi>Job</hi> was, and when he lived, for from all this I am inclinable to believe, that he was not a real but Parabolical or fictious perſon, or at leaſt that this was not his proper name, but only given him from the circumſtances of his life, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities with which he encountered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 98. That he might anſwer the like event of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> &amp;c. or rather of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and of them it is immediately that the Prophet there ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 169. The firſt of which is taken from the teſtimony of Scripture, the other from the nature of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This later topick I have not inſiſted upon with that accuracy of method,
<pb facs="tcp:93763:276"/> which might have been expected, and which I my ſelf did without queſtion intend, when I made the Diviſion; but yet I have not neglected it neither, ſee. <hi>from p. 310. to</hi> 319. and in the Preface <hi>from p. 14. to</hi> 16. and I have likewiſe inſiſted upon it, in my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the laws of nature, <hi>from p. 45 to</hi> 55.</p>

            <p>Moreover becauſe no deſcription is ſufficient to expreſs the heavineſs of the wrath of God upon the reprobate, therefore the torments and calamities that are inflicted upon them, are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out by coreporal repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch as darkneſs, and weeping, and gnaſhing of Teeth, and unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fire, and a Worm perpetually gnawing upon the heart: For by ſuch wayes of expreſſion as theſe, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Holy Ghoſt deſigned to affect all our ſenſes with horrour, as when it is ſaid, <hi>Iſa. 30, 33. That To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is ordained of old, he hath made it deep and large, the Pile thereof is fire and much Wood, the Breath of the Lord like a ſtream of Brimſtone doth kindle it.</hi> By which mode of expreſſion, as we ought
<pb facs="tcp:93763:277"/> to repreſent to our ſelves in the beſt manner we can, the miſerable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition of the damned, ſo ought we moſt eſpecially to reflect upon this, how wretched and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous a thing it is to be baniſhed for ever from the preſcence of God, and not only ſo, but alſo to feel the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Majeſty of God ſo ſet and bent againſt you, that it is impoſſible for you to turn your ſelf any way, but you ſhall ſtill be preſt and proſecuted by it. For firſt the wrath of God is like a conſuming fire, by which all things are devoured and ſwallowed up, and then in the next place you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that when God goes forth to judgment, he can make all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures attend him to execute his Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſo that the reprobate ſhall feel the Heaven, Earth, and Seas, and all the Creatures in them, whom God upon this occaſion ſhall make uſe of as his Inſtruments to demonſtrate the fierceneſs of his anger, all of them as it were inflamed with indignation againſt them, and armed for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, wherefore it is no ſlight ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apoſtle hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb facs="tcp:93763:278"/> againſt them that know not God, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 9. That <hi>they ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi> And as often as the Prophets endeavour to move our paſſions by corporal terrours, though conſidering the ſlowneſs of humane nature to be moved to that which is good, they cannot be thought to have any thing exceſſive or Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical in them, ſo often do they uſher in the judgments to come with terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying prodigies in the Sun and Moon, and in the whole courſe of Nature. Wherefore this is the meaning of all thoſe terrible repreſentations of the judgment to come, that the ſouls and conſciences of the Damned find no reſt, but are always vexed, and as it were ſcattered and confounded by a direful tempeſt, they feel themſelves torn and mangled by an angry God, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all over by deadly darts ſticking in them, they are afraid of his Thunder, and they are broken in pieces under his heavy hand. So that it would be better to be plunged into the deepeſt pit, or to ly ſuffocated under the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:93763:278"/> unfathomable depth, then to indure thoſe terrours of God and of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for one moment of time; and how much more intollerable than muſt it needs be to be beſieged and oppreſt by the ſame terrours for ever? So that this is at leaſt <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem,</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> for he grants that the torments of Hell as they are deſcribed in Scripture, under corporeal and ſenſible repreſentations, are indeed nothing elſe, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and torments of a guilty-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: and I ſay, that neceſſity and and guilt are inconſiſtent with each other, and that if they continue in the other world, to have the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning the nature and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of all humane actions which they have in this, it will be impoſſible there ſhould be any ſuch thing as Damnation, becauſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And it breaks out as naturally and as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently into ſuch works as theſe, as a red hot Furnace belches out Flames and ſparkes, or a Spring continually guſhes with an endleſs ebullition of Water.

            </p>
            <p>That is, there have been ſome in all Ages, who by the conduct of nature, have followed Virtue all their lives long: and theſe examples may be thought by ſome to inferr, as if the nature of Man were not wholly corrupt and depraved; ſince by the natural inſtinct there have been ſo many who have not only done many good and worthy actions, but have perſiſted in a ſteady courſe of Virtue, from one end of their lives to the other. But here it is to be conſidered, in the midſt of all
<pb facs="tcp:93763:282"/> this natural pravity, there is ſtill room left for the Grace of God, I do not mean a purging and cleanſing, but only a preventing and reſtraining Grace: for if God ſhould let the Minds of all Men looſe, every one to purſue every Man his own hearts deſire, there is no doubt but that every Man would give an experiment in himſelf of all thoſe evils, with which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath charged humane Nature. For what? how can you pretend to exempt your ſelf from the number of thoſe whoſe feet are ſwift to ſhed blood, whoſe hands are foul with rapine, and beſmeared with ſlaughter, whoſe Throats are an open Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, tongues full of deceit, and Lips tainted with Poiſon, whoſe works are unprofitable, unjuſt, rotten and deadly, whoſe Mind is without God, whoſe inward parts are very wickedneſs, whoſe eyes are watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Treachery and miſchief, whoſe Minds are puft up with inſolence and Pride, and all whoſe Members are made and fitted as it were, or ſet on purpoſe to commit infinite Villanies, and crimes without number, end, or
<pb facs="tcp:93763:283"/> meaſure? and if every Soul be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally addicted to all theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous impieties, as the Apoſtle makes no bones to pronounce it is, then we may know for certain what the conſequence would be, if God ſhould let all Men looſe to follow their own inclinations. There is no ſavage beaſt that would be ſo preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitant, ungovernable and outragious, no river how ſwift and violent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that can overflow it's Banks, with a more rapid and impetuous ſtream. In the elect God hath a way of curing theſe malignities, which I ſhall explain hereafter, but in the reprobate he only curbs and bridles their appetites, and takes care that they may not break out, ſo far forth as he ſees it neceſſary to keep the world in ſome tollerable order and quiet, which would be otherwiſe broken in pieces, by interfering ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and deſtructive inclinations. Hence it is ſo, that ſome are kept in aw by an inward ſence of ſhame, and others by a principle of fear, that they dare not actually break forth into many ſorts of wickedneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:93763:283"/> though notwithſtanding, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not altogether hide the impurity of their nature; there are others that have an opinion that virtue is for their intereſt, and upon that principle they aſpire after it, after a ſort, and as well as they can: and it is ſo ordered in others, that they ſhall emerge above the common dregs of the people, that by their authority they may keep them in order. Thus God by his providence bridles and reſtrains the perverſity of nature, that it may not break out into act, but he does not purge it and refine it by his Grace within.</p>

            <p>And a little after in the ſame Section, he produces a very lame diſtinction of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to make our actions wholly voluntary, although they be wholly neceſſary at the ſame time: his words are theſe,<note place="margin">De natuâ &amp; Grat. &amp; alibi.</note>

The true pinch of the controverſie lies here; Mankind, as they are now in their degenerate and lapſed eſtate, do commit ſin willingly, not by any external force or coaction; with a moſt prone and ready propenſion of mind, not by any violent compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but ſuch is the pravity of their nature, that they cannot of themſelves be moved or incited toany thing, but
<pb facs="tcp:93763:284"/> to what is evil.—But now I thought notwithſtanding this dictinction, that neceſſity, whether it proceed from outward cauſes, or whether it be bound up inwardly in the nature of the thing, had been equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in both caſes, and I ſee not how either ſort of theſe neceſſities, where they are ſo abſolute and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable, as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſuppoſes them to be, can be conſiſtent with Guilt.

            <p>Theſe Citations are I think, of themſelves, abundantly ſufficient to ſhew what opinion Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> had, of the neceſſity of humane actions, and the pravity of humane nature; and upon comparing theſe examples, with what I have laid to his charge in the <hi>Apologetical Vindication,</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the moſt partial and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd of his Diſciples, whether I have miſrepreſented him or no, or whether indeed it was poſſible for me to ſet him forth in worſe colours, than thoſe in which he hath thought fit to Paint, or to expreſs it in words more proper

            <p>That is, Thus therefore the Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues of wicked and prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are uſed to mutter, why ſhould God impute that as a ſin to men, which he hath put them under a neceſſity of doing by his decree? In anſwer to which exception, I ſhall not make uſe of that Weapon with which the Schoolmen are uſed to defend themſelves, that the fore-knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:93763:287"/> of God hinders not, but a Man may be guilty of ſin, ſince God does not foreſee or conſider it as any evil in himſelf, but only as a defect or pravity or corruption in his Creatures. For the objection would not be-ſatisfied thus, but would proceed further to urge in its own behalf, that God might have hindered thoſe evils which he foreſaw, if he had ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; which ſince he did not do, it is the ſame thing as if he had Created Man on ſet purpoſe, that he ſhould behave himſelf as he does upon the Earth. But if by the providence of God it comes to paſs, that Man is Created in ſuch a condition, that he is under a neceſſity of doing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he does, we muſt not charge that as a fault upon Men, which they cannot avoid, and which the will of God, which cannot be reſiſted, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligeth them to do. Let us try therefore ſome other way to untie this puzling knot. And firſt of all I ſay, that we ought all to ſubſcribe to that ſaying of <hi>Solomon,</hi> That God hath made all things for himſelf, and the Wicked for the day of evil.
<pb facs="tcp:93763:288"/> Therefore the caſe is this, that ſince the diſpoſal of all things is in the hand of God, and ſince he is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally and unaccountably inveſted with the power of Life and Death, he orders the matter ſo, by the eternal counſel and purpoſe of his will, that there ſhall be born ſome Men into the world, that ſhall be devoted to eternal ruine from their Mothers Womb, that ſo they may Glorifie his Name by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. If any ſhall ſay, that the providence or foreſight of God does not put a Man of it ſelf under any fatality or neceſſity of acting, but only that God created Man in that condition he is in, becauſe he foreſaw the future pravity of which he would be guilty, he ſpeaks indeed ſomething to the purpoſe, but yet very ſhort of the whole matter, the antients indeed are wont ſometimes to make uſe of this ſolution, but they do it with ſomething of doubt and heſitation; but the Scoolmen do ſo wholly rely upon an acquieſce in this, as if there were not the leaſt colour of objection to be brought againſt it.
<pb facs="tcp:93763:288"/> For my part I am clearly of opinion, that the Divine knowledge does not conclude the Creatures under any kind of fate or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity at all, notwithſtanding that there are ſome who will not grant thus much, but will needs have preſcience it ſelf to be a Cauſe. But to my thinking, <hi>Valla,</hi> although otherwiſe a perſon not very well ſeen in Theological Studies, hath determined this matter with greater prudence and judgment, than either the Ancient Fathers or the Schoolmen have done, and he tells us that all this contention is a controverſie about nothing, for that Life and Death are rather the effects of the Divine will then fore knowledge; if God only forſaw what Man would do, and did not alſo ordain and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point it by a poſitive decree, then indeed it would be to ſome purpoſe, to argue <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra</hi> upon this queſtion, whether the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God be capable of neceſſitating the Actions of Men; but ſince he does no otherwiſe foreſee what ſhall come to paſs, but only becauſe he hath appointed and decreed it within himſelf, it is to no purpoſe to talk of his knowledge, when it is ſo plain, that all things are ordered by his Will.</p>

            <p>That is, our Adverſaries deny that it is any where affirmed in Scripture in expreſs words, that God hath before hand decreed, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould periſh by his diſobedience, as if the ſame God, whom the Scripture ſets forth, as doing whatſoever he pleaſes both in Heaven and Earth, had made the nobleſt of his Creatures without decreeing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately fixing before hand what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do with him at the laſt, they tell us that <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt indued with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of will, that he might carve out his fortune for himſelf, and that God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed nothing, but only that he would deal with him according to his deſert, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his good uſe or abuſe of his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But if we content our ſelves with ſo cold and jejune an expedient as this, what will become of that omnipotence of God, whereby he governes all things according to the ſecret council of his will, which hath no dependence upon any thing without it ſelf, and after all the Divine predeſtination will exert and ſhew it ſelf in the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> whether they will or no. For it did not come to paſs by virtue of any natural cauſe, that all Men ſhould periſh for the
<pb facs="tcp:93763:290"/> fault of one, why therefore are they ſo loth to affirm or believe the ſame thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one Man, which they are forced to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce of all the reſt of Mankind? or why ſhould they loſe their labour by boggling and ſtartling to no purpoſe? The Scripture cry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s aloud, that all Men were Doomed to eternal Death in the perſon of one, which cannot be aſcribed to nature; it follows plainly, that it can be imputed only to the wonderful and hiden Counſel of God. It is ridiculous for thoſe doubty Patrons of Divine Juſtice, to ſtop at a feſcue lying on the ground, and yet make nothing to vault over a lofty beam. Again, I demand of thoſe men, how comes it to paſs that ſo many Nations together with their Infant Children ſhould by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> be involved in the ſentence of eternal Death, but only that it ſeemed good to God to have it ſo? Here they are utterly confounded and put to ſilence and are forced to hold their Tongues, though they are uſed to be loud enough at other times. An horrible decree I muſt confeſs, but yet no one can deny, but God did certainly know what would become of Man before he made him, and he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew no otherwiſe, but only that he had decreed before hand what end he ſhould have. If any Man here ſhall inveigh againſt the foreknowledge of God, it will be very raſhly and unadviſedly done, for why ſhould the Heavenly Judge be blamed for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs
<pb facs="tcp:93763:290"/> of his knowledge, and meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not ignorant of any thing that was to come? if there be any juſt reaſon of complaint at all, it muſt be taken not from his knowledge, but his will. Neither let it ſeem abſurd which I affirm, that God did not only foreſee the fall of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> firſt Parent, and in that fall, the ruine of his poſterity, but that he did alſo predetermine, and preordaine it.

            </p>
            <p>That is. Here there are ſome that are uſed to betake themſelves to a dictinction betwixt the poſitive and the negative will of God, or betwixt his decree and his permiſſion, by vertue of which diſtinction, they think to gain this point, that wicked Men periſh, not becauſe God ordaineth or appointeth that they ſhould, but only becauſe he doth not hinder it, or becauſe he ſtands by and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it to be done; but how can we ſay that he permits it, unleſs it be becauſe he wills it alſo; or that he is not willing it ſhould come to paſs, for nothing can reſiſt his will. But neither is it ſo probable in it ſelf, that men periſh by the Divine permiſſion, and not by his appointment, as if God had not beforehand determined with himſelf, what ſhould be the fate of the nobleſt of his
<pb facs="tcp:93763:291"/> Creatures. Wherefore I will not doubt to affirm plainly with St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> that the will of God is that neceſſity by which all things come to paſs, and that whatſoever he wills, muſt of neceſſity be, as that will truly and certainly fall out, whatſoever it is that he foreſees. But now if either the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> the <hi>Manichees,</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> or the <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> (for we have to do in this argument with theſe four ſorts of men) if all or any of theſe ſhall in defence and juſtification of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, plead that neceſſity in which they are bound up and fettered by the eternal decrees, ſo that they cannot act or move otherwiſe then they do, though they would never ſo fain, this will by no means ſerve their turn. For if nothing elſe be meant by Predeſtination, but only that it is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation or diſtribution of the Divine juſtice, which proceeds upon hidden, but yet without queſtion upon very good and worthy grounds, from hence it follows, becauſe the reprobate were not worthy to periſh, that it is juſt they ſhould. Add to this, that their Deſtruction depends in ſuch manner upon Predeſtination, as that all this while the cauſe and matter of their ruine is in themſelves. For the firſt Man fell, becauſe God ſaw it good, that he ſhould fall, but why he thought it good we cannot tell, only thus much we <hi>Certum tamen eſt non</hi> know, that he would not <hi>aliter cenſuiſſe, niſi, &amp;c.</hi> have decreed the fall of our firſt Parent, but
<pb facs="tcp:93763:292"/> only that he ſaw his Glory would be deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly illuſtrated by it. And when you hear mention of the Glory of God, then think of his juſtice. For that muſt at leaſt be juſt, which deſerves praiſe and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Wherefore though the fall of Man was ordained by the providence of God, yet he fell by occaſion of his own corruption. God when he made all things gave them this character, that they were exceeding good, that it might not be thought the corruption of any nature was a thing of Gods making, Therefore it is plain, that Man by his own pravity corrupted that nature which he had received pure and untainted from the hands of God, and drew poſterity after him into the common ruine. Wherefore let us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther betake our ſelves to that clear and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent cauſe of Damnation, which is to be found in the corruption of humane nature: a cauſe that is more near and preſent to us, then to ſeek for it in the hidden and incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble predeſtination of God; and let it not be thought a thing unreaſonable for an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane underſtanding, which is finite, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that there are ſome effects of the Divine Wiſedome, which it cannot fathom, and into which it ought not with a too nice and ſollicitous curioſity to pry; for it is a piece of Learning, or at leaſt of ingenuity, to confeſs our ſelves ignorant of thoſe things which cannot be known, or into which is not lawful for us to inquire; and a too great deſire
<pb facs="tcp:93763:292"/> of knowledge in caſes of this Nature is in effect nothing better than a ſort of madneſs.—In which Citation of Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> it is admirable to obſerve what artificial ſhuffling and cutting he hath uſed, and how he hath endeavoured to oppreſs the truth, under a load of words, that either have no ſence, or a ſence repugnant to and inconſiſtent with their Neighbours: for firſt he ſeems to make the Divine permiſſion and appointment to be exactly the ſame, then he takes them in ſunder, and will not allow the former to be ſufficient; he grants the predeſtination to be of it ſelf ſufficient to produce the predetermined effect, and yet to avoid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of the objection made by the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and others, he hath recourſe to the corruption of our natures, which he imputes to our ſelves. But now either <hi>Adam</hi> corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his nature voluntarily, or he did not; if he did, then he was a free and voluntary agent, which Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> denies, as may be ſeen in what hath been already cited out of him; if he did not, then he acted neceſſarily, and it is all one whether the neceſſity were a neceſſity of Nature, or a ſuperinduced neceſſity from without; it is equally a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in both caſes, but let it fare how it will with <hi>Adam,</hi> all the Calviniſtical tribe is agreed in this, that we that are his poſterity are always concluded under an irreſiſtible fate, and ſo the <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Epicurean</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection returnes with a force as irreſiſtible as
<pb facs="tcp:93763:293"/> that fate, by which humane Nature is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be acted. Again, I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how God is Glorified in the Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of neceſſary agents, but I underſtand very well that it is the greateſt reflection that either wit or folly in combination, with malice, and prophaneſs, can throw upon his juſtice. And I grant as well as he, that the Divine Nature is infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, but what is this to affirming thoſe things which we know to be falſe concerning it, and which being once received into our Creed, will in their juſt and unavoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence deſtroy all morality and all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</p>
            <p>To conclude, is it not a fine argument, it is unreaſonable to think that God had not determined with himſelf what he would do with the nobleſt of his Creatures, that therefore he would condemn ſo vaſt a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of them to eternal torments? a Man would think he might have found a better fate for the nobleſt of his Creatures.—</p>
            <p>There is but one thing more, and I have done with Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> till I come to ſum up the Evidence, which I ſhall do immediately in the concluſion of this work, and that is, that where I ſpeak of the ſpiritual and Heavenly Principle, I make the one to be as much, and as really a part of our ſelves as the other, from <hi>P.</hi> 368, to 370. But Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, <hi>l. 2. c. 2. ſ. 27. Spiritus non à natura eſt ſed à regeneratione;</hi> which I acknowledge in ſome proportion to be true: but take it of the
<pb facs="tcp:93763:293"/> whole thing, and it is falſe. See what I have ſaid in the place referred to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 206. And I ſhall prove immediately that the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> &amp;c. But it ſeems I forgot my ſelf, and did not prove it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed does it need any elaborate proof: for if God be not bound by his own decrees, then he may alter and change them from time to time, and ſo the elect and the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate are words that may change their object every moment, though they retain ſtill the ſame lawleſs and arbitrary ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And at that rate it will be true againſt Mr. <hi>Calvin, Fideles poſſunt excidere de gratia;</hi> and it will be but ſmall comfort for a Man to be ſure he is a favorite of Heaven to day, when he knows not but that to morrow he may fall into diſgrace by the croſs purpoſes of a changeable and fickle being.</p>

            <p>ANd now I have done with what I did not deſign when firſt I entred upon the point of obduration, with raking the Dunghil of Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtical Doctrines, an Employment which the noſe of <hi>Hercules</hi> would have refuſed, though he had the patience to cleanſe the <hi>Augean</hi> Stable: for certainly ſuch a medley of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were never ſeen to walk abroad with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion ſince the days of <hi>Moloc</hi> and <hi>Jupiter Latiaris,</hi> and ſince the <hi>Obſcenities</hi> of the <hi>Bacchanalii</hi> have ceaſt to be reckon'd among Religious Duties. For this is a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that juſtifies the worſt of actions, and gives ſucceſsful wickedneſs the upper hand of virtue; and if a Plot be diſappointed, or a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion happily defeated, this is only a ſign that the under fates, by which a particular conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and his accomplices are acted, are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by the prevailing ſtrength of the great governing Fate by which the world is managed, but ſtill add Fate to Faete, and there remains Fate, there is no harm done all this whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e; for where there is neceſſity there is no Law, and where there is no Law there is no Tranſgreſſion. It is a Religion, as I have proved, that denyes the exiſtence of an immaterial nature, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the hope for which ſo many confeſſors have endured the moſt exquiſite torments, and ſo many Martyrs have dyed, it is a Religion as impudent as its Profeſſors: it is not only
<pb facs="tcp:93763:294"/> diſobedient and refractory againſt Government, for what ſo ſtubborn, ſo inflexible as Fate? but, which is ſtill more ſacred, pardon me, the Majeſty of the beſt of Kings, it gives the ly to the experience of Ages, and by the new knack of an <hi>Ignoramus Jury,</hi> accuſes common ſence of Perjury and Subornation; it is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which if it be not downwright Athieſm, an hopeful thing to be called by that name, and he that denies the exiſtence of immateral nature does in effect deny the exiſtence of a God, yet it is at leaſt idolatrous, by paying its Devotions to an object as diſtant from, and as oppoſite and contrary to the nature of God, as the top of Heaven is diſtant from the Centre of the Earth, or as the two Souls are removed from each other. It is a Religion that burleſques and ridicules the Goſpel, and puts far greater affronts upon the perſon, and the Sacrifice of Chriſt, than ever. The <hi>Arians</hi> in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, or the more groſs and impudent their fellow Materialiſts, the <hi>Socinian</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers themſelves have done. This Doctrine alone, though there were nothing elſe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, makes it a neceſſary duty in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to put the Laws in execution againſt the Diſſenting Party, among whom it almoſt univerſally prevails, and tis in vain to think to oblige this ſort of men, by tolleration or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, for their Principles tell them, they are not beholden to us, but to a reſtraining and irreſiſtible Grace, by which a Bridle is put into the Jaws of the wicked, by which they
<pb facs="tcp:93763:295"/> are chain'd up like Maſtiffs, and Muzzled like Ferrets, that would otherwiſe devour them and tear them in pieces, which being their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple 'tis no wonder to find them ſo ungrateful as they are, after ſo many repeated Acts of a Grace that would it ſelf want pardon, were it not the Grace and mercy of a King.</p>
